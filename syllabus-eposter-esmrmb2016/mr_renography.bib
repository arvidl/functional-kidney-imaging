  Abstract                 = {Numerical estimation of the size of the kidney is useful in evaluating conditions of the kidney, especially, when serial MR imaging is performed to evaluate the kidney function. This paper presents a new method for automatic segmentation of the kidney in three-dimensional (3D) MR images, by extracting texture features and statistical matching of geometrical shape of the kidney. A set of Wavelet-based support vector machines (W-SVMs) is trained on the MR images. The W-SVMs capture texture priors of MRI for classification of the kidney and non-kidney tissues in different zones around the kidney boundary. In the segmentation procedure, these W-SVMs are trained to tentatively label each voxel around the kidney model as a kidney or non-kidney voxel by texture matching. A probability kidney model is created using 10 segmented MRI data. The model is initially localized based on the intensity profiles in three directions. The weight functions are defined for each labeled voxel for each Wavelet-based, intensity-based, and model-based label. Consequently, each voxel has three labels and three weights for the Wavelet feature, intensity, and probability model. Using a 3D edge detection method, the model is re-localized and the segmented kidney is modified based on a region growing method in the model region. The probability model is re-localized based on the results and this loop continues until the segmentation converges. Experimental results with mouse MRI data show the good performance of the proposed method in segmenting the kidney in MR images.},

The use of different software tools adapted to the nature of each data source can make research work cumbersome and time consuming. It follows that data is not often used to its fullest potential thus limiting exploratory analysis. This paper presents an ancillary software tool called BRAVIZ that integrates interactive visualization with real-time statistical analyses, facilitating access to multi-facetted neuroscience data and automating many cumbersome and error-prone tasks required to explore such data. Rather than relying on abstract numerical indicators, BRAVIZ emphasizes brain images as the main object of the analysis process of individuals or groups. BRAVIZ facilitates exploration of trends or relationships to gain an integrated view of the phenomena studied, thus motivating discovery of new hypotheses. A case study is presented that incorporates brain structure and function outcomes together with different types of clinical data.},

The enhancement curves in the aorta and the kidney were analyzed with the cortical-compartment and Patlak-Rutland models to assess the GFR.A substantial correlation was observed between the GFR measured with MRI using the cortical-compartment model and the plasma clearance of 51Cr-EDTA (r=0.821, P=0.004). No significant correlation was observed between the 51Cr-EDTA clearance (r=0.628, P=0.052) and the GFR obtained with the Patlak-Rutland model in regions of interest (ROIs) encompassing the renal cortex and medulla. A Bland and Altman analysis showed that GFR(cortical) (compartment) agreed better with the 51Cr-EDTA clearance compared to GFR(Patlak) when ROIs were limited to the cortex. However, the GFR values obtained by MRI were lower than the plasma clearance of 51Cr-EDTA.MRI with a cortical-compartment model provides more accurate assessments of glomerular filtration than the Patlak-Rutland model.},

  Abstract                 = {In addition to excellent anatomical depiction, MRI techniques have expanded to study functional aspects of renal physiology, such as renal perfusion, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or tissue oxygenation. This review will focus on current developments with an emphasis on clinical applicability.The method of GFR determination is largely heterogeneous and still has weaknesses. However, the technique of employing liver disappearance curves has been shown to be accurate in healthy persons and patients with chronic kidney disease. In potential kidney donors, complete evaluation of kidney anatomy and function can be accomplished in a single-stop investigation. Techniques without contrast media can be utilized to measure renal tissue oxygenation (blood oxygen level-dependent MRI) or perfusion (arterial spin labeling) and could aid in the diagnosis and treatment of ischemic renal diseases, such as renal artery stenosis. Diffusion imaging techniques may provide information on spatially restricted water diffusion and tumor cellularity.Functional MRI opens new horizons in studying renal physiology and pathophysiology in vivo. Although extensively utilized in research, labor-intensive postprocessing and lack of standardization currently limit the clinical applicability of functional MRI. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the clinical value of functional magnetic resonance techniques for early discovery and characterization of kidney disease.},

In 10 of the 11 swine, a bag of ice was placed on the hilum of 1 kidney at the beginning of isoflurane administration to further reduce perfusion in 1 kidney.Both ASL and microspheres tracked the expected cortical perfusion changes (P < 0.02) across the interventions, including an increase in perfusion during the acetylcholine challenge and decrease during the administration of isoflurane. Both techniques also measured lower cortical perfusion in the iced compared with the non-iced kidneys (P ≤ 0.01). The ASL values were systematically lower compared with microsphere perfusion. Very good correlation (r = 0.81, P < 0.0001) was observed between the techniques, and the relationship appeared linear for perfusion values in the expected physiologic range (microsphere perfusion <550 mL/min/100 g) although ASL values saturated for perfusion >550 mL/min/100 g.Cortical perfusion measured with ASL correlated with microspheres and reliably detected changes in renal perfusion in response to physiologic challenge.},

Data were acquired with a 2D saturation-recovery TurboFLASH sequence. In order to test the dependence of the results on size and location of the manually drawn triggering regions of interest (ROIs), three widely differing triggering regions were defined by one observer. Mean value, standard deviation, and variability of the renal function parameters plasma flow (F(P)), plasma volume (V(P)), plasma transit time (T(P)), tubular flow (F(T)), tubular volume (V(T)), and tubular transit time (T(T)) were calculated on a per-patient basis.the results show that triggered data have adequate temporal resolution to measure blood flow. The overall average values of the function parameters were: 152.77 (F(P)), 15.18 (V(P)), 6,73 (T(P)), 18.50 (F(T)), 35.36 (V(T)), and 117.67 (T(T)). The variability (calculated in \% SD from the mean value) for three different respiratory triggering regions defined on a per-patient basis was between 0.81\% and 9.87\% for F(P), 1.45\% and 8.19\% for V(P), 0\% and 9.63\% for T(P), 2.15\% and 12.23\% for T(F), 0.8\% and 17.28\% for V(T), and 1.97\% and 12.87\% for T(T).triggering reduces the oscillations in the signal curves and produces sharper parametric maps. In contrast to numerically challenging approaches like registration and segmentation it can be applied in clinical routine, but a (semi)-automatic approach to select the triggering ROI is desirable to reduce user dependence.},

  Abstract                 = {The United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) commit significant support to open-source data and software resources in order to foment reproducibility in the biomedical imaging sciences. Here, we report and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging Tools (ANTs), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction results (Jaccard=0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard=0.669±0.022). Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal template construction and brain labeling.},

  Abstract                 = {To assess the correlation between each of intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) metrics in renal parenchyma with renal function, in a cohort of patients with chronic liver disease.Thirty patients with liver disease underwent abdominal MRI at 1.5T, including a coronal respiratory-triggered IVIM-DWI sequence and a coronal 3D FLASH DCE-MRI acquisition. Diffusion signals in the renal cortex and medulla were fitted to the IVIM model to estimate the diffusion coefficient (D), pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*), and perfusion fraction (PF). The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was calculated using all b-values. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR), cortical and medullary renal plasma flow (RPF), mean transit times (MTT) of vascular and tubular compartments and the whole kidney, were calculated from DCE-MRI data by fitting to a three-compartment model. The estimated GFR (eGFR) was calculated from serum creatinine measured 30 ± 27 days of MRI.ADC, PF, and RPF were significantly higher in renal cortex vs. medulla (P < 10(-5) ). DCE-MRI GFR significantly correlated with, but underestimated, eGFR (Spearman's r/P = 0.49/0.01). IVIM-DWI parameters were not significantly correlated with eGFR. DCE-MRI GFR correlated weakly with D (cortex, r/P = 0.3/0.03; medulla r/P = 0.27/0.05) and ADC (cortex r/P = 0.28/0.04; medulla r/P = 0.34/0.01). Weak correlations were observed for pooled cortical and medullar RPF with PF (r/P = 0.32/10(-3) ) and with ADC (r/P = 0.29/0.0025). Significant negative correlations were observed for vascular MTT with cortical D* (r/P = -0.38/0.004) and D*×PF (r/P = -0.34/0.01).The weak correlations between renal IVIM and DCE-MRI perfusion parameters imply that these functional measures could be complementary.

  Abstract                 = {Quantitative dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) provides estimates of physiologically relevant parameters related to tissue blood flow, vascular permeability, and tissue volume fractions which can then be used for prognostic and diagnostic reasons. However, standard techniques for DCE-MRI analysis ignore intra-voxel diffusion, which may play an important role in contrast agent distribution and voxel signal intensity and, thus, will affect quantification of the aforementioned parameters. To investigate the effect of intra-voxel diffusion on quantitative DCE-MRI, we developed a finite element model of contrast enhancement at the voxel level. For diffusion in the range of that expected for gadolinium chelates in tissue (i.e., 1 × 10(-4) to 4 × 10(-4) mm(2)/s), parameterization errors range from -58\% to 12\% for K(trans), -9\% to 8\% for ve, and -60\% to 213\% for vp over the range of K(trans), v(e), v(p), and temporal resolutions investigated. Thus the results show that diffusion has a significant effect on parameterization using standard techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is a promising technique to characterize pathology and evaluate treatment response. However, analysis of DCE-MRI data is complex and benefits from concurrent analysis of multiple kinetic models and parameters. Few software tools are currently available that specifically focuses on DCE-MRI analysis with multiple kinetic models. Here, we developed ROCKETSHIP, an open-source, flexible and modular software for DCE-MRI analysis. ROCKETSHIP incorporates analyses with multiple kinetic models, including data-driven nested model analysis.ROCKETSHIP was implemented using the MATLAB programming language. Robustness of the software to provide reliable fits using multiple kinetic models is demonstrated using simulated data. Simulations also demonstrate the utility of the data-driven nested model analysis. Applicability of ROCKETSHIP for both preclinical and clinical studies is shown using DCE-MRI studies of the human brain and a murine tumor model.A DCE-MRI software suite was implemented and tested using simulations. Its applicability to both preclinical and clinical datasets is shown. ROCKETSHIP was designed to be easily accessible for the beginner, but flexible enough for changes or additions to be made by the advanced user as well. The availability of a flexible analysis tool will aid future studies using DCE-MRI. A public release of ROCKETSHIP is available at https://github.com/petmri/ROCKETSHIP .},

  Abstract                 = {Techniques to measure morphological parameters, such as glomerular (and thereby nephron) number, glomerular size, and kidney volume, have been vital to understanding factors contributing to chronic kidney disease (CKD). These techniques have also been important to understanding the associations between CKD and other systemic and cardiovascular diseases and have led to the identification of developmental risk factors for these pathologies. However, existing techniques in quantitative kidney morphology are resource- and time-consuming and are destructive to the organ. This review discusses the emerging generation of techniques to study kidney morphology quantitatively using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using the intravenous injection of the superparamagnetic nanoparticle cationic ferritin, which binds to the glomerular basement membrane. A primary advantage of MRI over previously established techniques is the ability to quantify morphology in the intact organ with minimal sample preparation. We highlight areas of research where MRI-based morphological measurements will be helpful in animal models and possibly diagnostic clinical nephrology, discuss technical challenges in light of the progress in MRI techniques to date, and identify novel measurements that may be possible using MRI, both ex vivo and in vivo.},

  Abstract                 = {The total number of glomeruli (nephrons) in a kidney is an important microanatomical parameter for at least three reasons: it provides an index of the success/extent of nephrogenesis and can thereby provide insights into the roles of specific genes and feto-maternal environmental factors in nephrogenesis; low nephron number has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular and renal disease in adulthood; and knowledge of quantitative kidney microanatomy can illuminate our understanding of physiological mechanisms in health and disease. A range of methods has been used to count glomeruli in kidneys over the past 100 years, with design-based stereology (the physical disector/fractionator combination) considered the gold standard. However, this approach is labor-intensive and expensive, and therefore is not utilized by most laboratories. A new method for counting and sizing every glomerulus in the kidney has recently been described. This method involves in vivo labeling of glomeruli with cationic ferritin, and then magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the ex vivo kidney. Values are obtained in one sixth of the time of disector-based approaches. This new MRI method holds great promise for studies of glomerular number and size ex vivo and in vivo.},

Simulated tissues consisted of pixel clusters of calculated dynamic signal changes for combinations of Tofts model pharmacokinetic parameters (volume transfer constant [K(trans) ], extravascular extracellular volume fraction [ve ]), longitudinal relaxation time (T1 ). The clinical group comprised 27 patients treated for rectal cancer, with 36 3T DCE-MR scans performed between November 2012 and February 2014, including dual-flip-angle T1 mapping and a dynamic postcontrast T1 -weighted, 3D spoiled gradient-echo sequence. The clinical and simulated images were postprocessed with five SPs to measure K(trans) , ve , and the initial area under the gadolinium curve (iAUGC). Modified Bland-Altman analysis was conducted, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and within-subject coefficients of variation were calculated.Thirty-one examinations from 23 patients were of sufficient technical quality and postprocessed. Measurement errors were observed on the simulated data for all the pharmacokinetic parameters and SPs, with a bias ranging from -0.19 min(-1) to 0.09 min(-1) for K(trans) , -0.15 to 0.01 for ve , and -0.65 to 1.66 mmol.L(-1) .min for iAUGC. The ICC between SPs revealed moderate agreement for the simulated data (K(trans) : 0.50; ve : 0.67; iAUGC: 0.77) and very poor agreement for the clinical data (K(trans) : 0.10; ve : 0.16; iAUGC: 0.21).Significant errors were found in the calculated DCE-MRI pharmacokinetic parameters for the perfusion analysis SPs, resulting in poor inter-software reproducibility.

Reference single-kidney GFRs were measured by radionuclide renography. The coefficient of variation of GFR (CV) was determined for each method by Monte Carlo analyses for one healthy and one dysfunctional kidney at a noise level (sigma(n)) of 2\%, 5\%, and 10\%.GFR estimates in patients varied from 6\% overestimation (BR) to 50\% underestimation (PR and 2CD applied to cortical data). Correlations with reference GFRs ranged from R = 0.74 (2CD, cortical data) to R = 0.85 (BR). In simulations, the lowest CV was produced by 3C-IRF in healthy kidney (1.7sigma(n)) and by PR in diseased kidney ((2.2-2.4)sigma(n)). In both kidneys the highest CV was obtained with 2CD ((5.9-8.2)sigma(n)) and with 3CD in diseased kidney (8.9sigma(n) at sigma(n) = 10\%).GFR estimates depend on the renal model and type of data used. Two- and three-compartment models produce comparable GFR correlations.},

  Abstract                 = {Assessing and mitigating the various sources of bias and variance associated with image quantification algorithms is essential to the use of such algorithms in clinical research and practice. Assessment is usually accomplished with grid-based digital reference objects (DRO) or, more recently, digital anthropomorphic phantoms based on normal human anatomy. Publicly available digital anthropomorphic phantoms can provide a basis for generating realistic model-based DROs that incorporate the heterogeneity commonly found in pathology. Using a publicly available vascular input function (VIF) and digital anthropomorphic phantom of a normal human brain, a methodology was developed to generate a DRO based on the general kinetic model (GKM) that represented realistic and heterogeneously enhancing pathology. GKM parameters were estimated from a deidentified clinical dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI exam. This clinical imaging volume was co-registered with a discrete tissue model, and model parameters estimated from clinical images were used to synthesize a DCE-MRI exam that consisted of normal brain tissues and a heterogeneously enhancing brain tumor. An example application of spatial smoothing was used to illustrate potential applications in assessing quantitative imaging algorithms. A voxel-wise Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated negligible differences between the parameters estimated with and without spatial smoothing (using a small radius Gaussian kernel). In this work, we reported an extensible methodology for generating model-based anthropomorphic DROs containing normal and pathological tissue that can be used to assess quantitative imaging algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of region of interest (ROI) size and positioning on perfusion and permeability parameters as well as on interobserver and intraobserver variability of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE-MRI) of primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and metastases.Thirty-nine DCE-MRI examinations of 34 patients with primary RCC and 20 examinations of 9 patients with RCC metastases obtained at 1.5 T were evaluated. Pretreatment and posttreatment analysis with antiangiogenic therapy was performed in 4 patients with primary RCCs and 5 patients with metastases. The ROIs of the whole tumor (wROI), the circular edge (cROI), a user-defined arbitrary small region (sROI), and a semiautomated segmented ROI were independently defined by 2 readers on 1 slice on arterial phase DCE-MRI images or on parametric plasma-flow maps. Analysis with a 2-compartment exchange model provided 4 parameters: plasma flow (FP), plasma volume (vp), permeability-surface product (PS), and extravascular-extracellular volume (ve). Interobserver and intraobserver parameter correlations were calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient, and within-subject variability were considered on the basis of the coefficient of variation. Differences in measurement values of variable ROI size were assessed with paired t test.Mean values of FP and vp with sROIs were significantly higher than those with wROI, cROI, and semiautomated segmented ROI placement in tumor or metastases. Values of ve showed no significant difference between ROI sizes. The highest interobserver and intraobserver correlation with 0.99/0.98 for metastases and 0.97/0.98 for primary RCCs, respectively, was observed for all parameters when defining wROIs on dynamic images. Perfusion parameters of wROI measurements for FP (dynamic, 0.97; parametric maps, 0.96) and vp (0.95/0.89) showed higher interobserver correlation than did permeability parameters ve (0.64/0.6) and PS (0.79/0.5) in primary RCCs. The wROIs showed also the lowest within-subject coefficients of variation for perfusion parameters FP and vp compared with cROI and sROIs in primary RCCs and metastases.The ROI size and positioning do substantially influence quantitative perfusion and permeability parameters in DCE-MRI. The best interobserver and intraobserver correlation can be obtained when defining a whole-tumor ROI. The perfusion parameters are the most reliable, whereas the permeability parameters are more susceptible to interobserver variability. No significant differences between placing ROIs on morphological or parametric images were observed.},

  Abstract                 = {Technical developments in both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) have helped to reduce scan times and expedited the development of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging techniques. Since the temporal change of the image signal following the administration of a diffusible, extracellular contrast agent (CA) is related to the local blood supply and the extravasation of the CA into the interstitial space, DCE imaging can be used to assess tissue microvasculature and microcirculation. It is the aim of this review to summarize the biophysical and tracer kinetic principles underlying this emerging imaging technique offering great potential for non-invasive characterization of tumour angiogenesis.In the first part, the relevant contrast mechanisms are presented that form the basis to relate signal variations measured by serial CT and MRI to local tissue concentrations of the administered CA. In the second part, the concepts most widely used for tracer kinetic modelling of concentration-time courses derived from measured DCE image data sets are described in a consistent and unified manner to highlight their particular structure and assumptions as well as the relationships among them. Finally, the concepts presented are exemplified by the analysis of representative DCE data as well as discussed with respect to present and future applications in cancer diagnosis and therapy.Depending on the specific protocol used for the acquisition of DCE image data and the particular model applied for tracer kinetic analysis of the derived concentration-time courses, different aspects of tumour angiogenesis can be quantified in terms of well-defined physiological tissue parameters.DCE imaging offers promising prospects for improved tumour diagnosis, individualization of cancer treatment as well as the evaluation of novel therapeutic concepts in preclinical and early-stage clinical trials.},

  Abstract                 = {Medical imaging has seen substantial and rapid technical advances during the past decade, including advances in image acquisition devices, processing and analysis software, and agents to enhance specificity. Traditionally, medical imaging has defined anatomy, but increasingly newer, more advanced, imaging technologies provide biochemical and physiologic information based on both static and dynamic modalities. These advanced technologies are important not only for detecting disease but for characterizing and assessing change of disease with time or therapy. Because of the rapidity of these advances, research to determine the utility of quantitative imaging in either clinical research or clinical practice has not had time to mature. Methods to appropriately develop, assess, regulate, and reimburse must be established for these advanced technologies. Efficient and methodical processes that meet the needs of stakeholders in the biomedical research community, therapeutics developers, and health care delivery enterprises will ultimately benefit individual patients. To help address this, the authors formed a collaborative program-the Quantitative Imaging Biomarker Alliance. This program draws from the very successful precedent set by the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise effort but is adapted to the needs of imaging science. Strategic guidance supporting the development, qualification, and deployment of quantitative imaging biomarkers will lead to improved standardization of imaging tests, proof of imaging test performance, and greater use of imaging to predict the biologic behavior of tissue and monitor therapy response. These, in turn, confer value to corporate stakeholders, providing incentives to bring new and innovative products to market.},

Data from the kidneys and descending aorta were analyzed using both a Rutland-Patlak plot and a compartmental model. MR estimates of the SK-GFR were compared with standard radioisotope measures in a total of 75 kidneys.Estimates of renal function using both techniques correlated well with radioisotope-assessed SK-GFR (Spearman's rho=0.81, Rutland-Patlak; rho=0.71, compartmental model). The Rutland-Patlak approach provided a near one-to-one correspondence, while the compartmental method tended to overestimate SK-GFR. However, the compartmental model fits to the experimental data were significantly better than those obtained using the Rutland-Patlak approach.DCE-MRI of the kidneys provides data that correlate well with reference measures of SK-GFR. However, further work, including image registration, is needed to isolate measurement of glomerular filtration to the level of the renal cortex.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) time series data are subject to unavoidable physiological motion during acquisition (e.g., due to breathing) and this motion causes significant errors when fitting tracer kinetic models to the data, particularly with voxel-by-voxel fitting approaches. Motion correction is problematic, as contrast enhancement introduces new features into postcontrast images and conventional registration similarity measures cannot fully account for the increased image information content. A methodology is presented for tracer kinetic model-driven registration that addresses these problems by explicitly including a model of contrast enhancement in the registration process. The iterative registration procedure is focused on a tumor volume of interest (VOI), employing a three-dimensional (3D) translational transformation that follows only tumor motion. The implementation accurately removes motion corruption in a DCE-MRI software phantom and it is able to reduce model fitting errors and improve localization in 3D parameter maps in patient data sets that were selected for significant motion problems. Sufficient improvement was observed in the modeling results to salvage clinical trial DCE-MRI data sets that would otherwise have to be rejected due to motion corruption.},

Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and quantitative parametric mapping of the magnetic resonance (MR) relaxation times T 2* and T 2 are thought to provide surrogates of renal tissue oxygenation. The validity and efficacy of this technique for quantitative characterization of local tissue oxygenation and its changes under different functional conditions have not been systematically examined yet and remain to be established. For this purpose, the development of an integrative multimodality approaches is essential. Here we describe an integrated hybrid approach (MR-PHYSIOL) that combines established quantitative physiological measurements with T 2* (T 2) mapping and MR-based kidney size measurements. Standardized reversible (patho)physiologically relevant interventions, such as brief periods of aortic occlusion, hypoxia, and hyperoxia, are used for detailing the relation between the MR-PHYSIOL parameters, in particular between renal T 2* and tissue oxygenation.},

  Abstract                 = {Intrarenal autoregulatory mechanisms maintain renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) independent of renal perfusion pressure (RPP) over a defined range (80-180 mmHg). Such autoregulation is mediated largely by the myogenic and the macula densa-tubuloglomerular feedback (MD-TGF) responses that regulate preglomerular vasomotor tone primarily of the afferent arteriole. Differences in response times allow separation of these mechanisms in the time and frequency domains. Mechanotransduction initiating the myogenic response requires a sensing mechanism activated by stretch of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and coupled to intracellular signaling pathways eliciting plasma membrane depolarization and a rise in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]i). Proposed mechanosensors include epithelial sodium channels (ENaC), integrins, and/or transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Increased [Ca(2+)]i occurs predominantly by Ca(2+) influx through L-type voltage-operated Ca(2+) channels (VOCC). Increased [Ca(2+)]i activates inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) and ryanodine receptors (RyR) to mobilize Ca(2+) from sarcoplasmic reticular stores. Myogenic vasoconstriction is sustained by increased Ca(2+) sensitivity, mediated by protein kinase C and Rho/Rho-kinase that favors a positive balance between myosin light-chain kinase and phosphatase. Increased RPP activates MD-TGF by transducing a signal of epithelial MD salt reabsorption to adjust afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction. A combination of vascular and tubular mechanisms, novel to the kidney, provides for high autoregulatory efficiency that maintains RBF and GFR, stabilizes sodium excretion, and buffers transmission of RPP to sensitive glomerular capillaries, thereby protecting against hypertensive barotrauma. A unique aspect of the myogenic response in the renal vasculature is modulation of its strength and speed by the MD-TGF and by a connecting tubule glomerular feedback (CT-GF) mechanism. Reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide are modulators of myogenic and MD-TGF mechanisms. Attenuated renal autoregulation contributes to renal damage in many, but not all, models of renal, diabetic, and hypertensive diseases. This review provides a summary of our current knowledge regarding underlying mechanisms enabling renal autoregulation in health and disease and methods used for its study.},

The two-compartment model was modified with the impulse residue function in this study. First, the reliability of GFR measurement of the proposed model was compared with other published models in Monte Carlo simulation at different noise levels. Then, functional parameters were estimated in six healthy rabbits to test the feasibility of the new model. Moreover, in order to investigate its validity of GFR estimation, two rabbits underwent acute ischemia surgical procedure in unilateral kidney before DCE-MRI, and pixel-wise measurements were implemented to detect the cortical GFR alterations between normal and abnormal kidneys.The lowest variability of GFR and RPF measurements were found in the proposed model in the comparison. Mean GFR was 3.03±1.1 ml/min and mean RPF was 2.64±0.5 ml/g/min in normal animals, which were in good agreement with the published values. Moreover, large GFR decline was found in dysfunction kidneys comparing to the contralateral control group.Results in our study demonstrate that measurement of renal kinetic parameters based on the proposed model is feasible and it has the ability to discriminate GFR changes in healthy and diseased kidneys.},

  Abstract                 = {To demonstrate the feasibility of the improved temporal resolution by using compressed sensing (CS) combined imaging sequence in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) of kidney, and investigate its quantitative effects on renal perfusion measurements.Ten rabbits were included in the accelerated scans with a CS-combined 3D pulse sequence. To evaluate the image quality, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were compared between the proposed CS strategy and the conventional full sampling method. Moreover, renal perfusion was estimated by using the separable compartmental model in both CS simulation and realistic CS acquisitions.The CS method showed DCE-MRI images with improved temporal resolution and acceptable image contrast, while presenting significantly higher SNR than the fully sampled images (p<.01) at 2-, 3- and 4-X acceleration. In quantitative measurements, renal perfusion results were in good agreement with the fully sampled one (concordance correlation coefficient=0.95, 0.91, 0.88) at 2-, 3- and 4-X acceleration in CS simulation. Moreover, in realistic acquisitions, the estimated perfusion by the separable compartmental model exhibited no significant differences (p>.05) between each CS-accelerated acquisition and the full sampling method.The CS-combined 3D sequence could improve the temporal resolution for DCE-MRI in kidney while yielding diagnostically acceptable image quality, and it could provide effective measurements of renal perfusion.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) provides a noninvasive method for evaluating tumor vasculature patterns based on contrast accumulation and washout. However, due to limited imaging resolution and tumor tissue heterogeneity, tracer concentrations at many pixels often represent a mixture of more than one distinct compartment. This pixel-wise partial volume effect (PVE) would have profound impact on the accuracy of pharmacokinetics studies using existing compartmental modeling (CM) methods. We, therefore, propose a convex analysis of mixtures (CAM) algorithm to explicitly mitigate PVE by expressing the kinetics in each pixel as a nonnegative combination of underlying compartments and subsequently identifying pure volume pixels at the corners of the clustered pixel time series scatter plot simplex. The algorithm is supported theoretically by a well-grounded mathematical framework and practically by plug-in noise filtering and normalization preprocessing. We demonstrate the principle and feasibility of the CAM-CM approach on realistic synthetic data involving two functional tissue compartments, and compare the accuracy of parameter estimates obtained with and without PVE elimination using CAM or other relevant techniques. Experimental results show that CAM-CM achieves a significant improvement in the accuracy of kinetic parameter estimation. We apply the algorithm to real DCE-MRI breast cancer data and observe improved pharmacokinetic parameter estimation, separating tumor tissue into regions with differential tracer kinetics on a pixel-by-pixel basis and revealing biologically plausible tumor tissue heterogeneity patterns. This method combines the advantages of multivariate clustering, convex geometry analysis, and compartmental modeling approaches. The open-source MATLAB software of CAM-CM is publicly available from the Web.},

Both the basis signals and the sparse coefficients are learned by minimizing a functional consisting of a data fidelity term and a sparsity inducing penalty. Tissue segmentation is then obtained by applying a standard clustering algorithm to the computed representation.Quantitative estimates on two real data sets are presented. In the first case, the overlap with expert annotation measured with the DICE metric is nearly 90\% and thus 5\% more accurate than state-of-the-art techniques. In the second case, assessment of the correlation between quantitative scores, obtained by the proposed method against imagery manually annotated by two experts, achieved a Pearson coefficient of 0.83 and 0.87, and a Spearman coefficient of 0.83 and 0.71, respectively.The sparse representation of DCE MRI signals obtained by means of adaptive dictionary learning techniques appears to be well-suited for unsupervised tissue segmentation and applicable to different clinical contexts with little effort.},

  Abstract                 = {Stenting of the stenosed renal artery is commonly employed in atheromatous renovascular disease (ARVD) in order to revascularize the affected kidney. However, it is still far from clear which patient subgroups should be revascularized as stenting carries small but significant risks. We have previously demonstrated that the ratio of magnetic resonance-measured renal volume to isotopic single kidney glomerular filtration rate (isoSK-GFR) is higher in kidneys which show functional improvement after revascularization. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does not require contrast administration and is sensitive to changes in tissue concentration of deoxyhaemoglobin.In this study, we test the hypothesis that baseline BOLD R2* map signal and R2*:isoSK-GFR ratio will provide an additional independent predictive biomarker of response to revascularization.Studies were performed in 28 subjects (16 ARVD and 12 controls). All subjects had R2* mapping and isoSK-GFR measured at baseline and at 4-month follow-up. MRI data were collected on a 3 T whole-body MRI scanner using a coronal dual-echo, 2D gradient-echo breath-hold acquisition. Parenchymal regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on a representative slice through the middle of the kidney. Parametric maps of R2* were generated and mean values of R2* were calculated for every ROI. The ratio of R2*:isoSK-GFR at baseline was significantly greater in kidneys where renal function improved (5.91 ± 6.51) versus stable (1.78 ± 1.11), deteriorated (2.15 ± 1.79) or controls (1.5 ± 0.91), P = 0.003. R2*:isoSK-GFR ratio that was greater than 95\% confidence interval of the control kidneys was 66.7\% sensitive, but 85.7\% specific in predicting a positive renal functional outcome.These pilot data show that BOLD R2* imaging, presumably by detecting intra-renal deoxyhaemoglobin in still viable 'hibernating' parenchyma, coupled with isoSK-GFR may provide an effective predictive biomarker for positive renal functional response to revascularization. R2* imaging is non-invasive, quick to perform and could provide further insight into reversible parenchymal changes in ARVD kidneys.},

  Abstract                 = {The vascular network carries blood throughout the body, delivering oxygen to tissues and providing a pathway for communication between distant organs. The network is hierarchical and structured, but also dynamic, especially at the smaller scales. Remodeling of the microvasculature occurs in response to local changes in oxygen, gene expression, cell-cell communication, and chemical and mechanical stimuli from the microenvironment. These local changes occur as a result of physiological processes such as growth and exercise, as well as acute and chronic diseases including stroke, cancer, and diabetes, and pharmacological intervention. While the vasculature is an important therapeutic target in many diseases, drugs designed to inhibit vascular growth have achieved only limited success, and no drug has yet been approved to promote therapeutic vascular remodeling. This highlights the challenges involved in identifying appropriate therapeutic targets in a system as complex as the vasculature. Systems biology approaches provide a means to bridge current understanding of the vascular system, from detailed signaling dynamics measured in vitro and pre-clinical animal models of vascular disease, to a more complete picture of vascular regulation in vivo. This will translate to an improved ability to identify multi-component biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of therapy that are easy to measure in vivo, as well as better drug targets for specific disease states. In this review, we summarize systems biology approaches that have advanced our understanding of vascular function and dysfunction in vivo, with a focus on computational modeling.},

This is a hypothesis-generating pilot study assessing the effect of nephrectomy on renal function in healthy kidney donors.Eight living kidney donors underwent arterial spin labelling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and GFR measurement prior to and 1 year after nephrectomy. Chromium-51 labelled ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid ((51)Cr-EDTA) with multi-blood sampling was undertaken and GFR calculated. The RBF and GFR obtained were used to calculate FF.All donors showed an increase in single kidney GFR of 24 - 75 \%, and all but two showed an increase in FF (-7 to +52 \%) after nephrectomy. The increase in RBF, and hence RPF, post-nephrectomy was not as great as the increase in GFR in seven out of eight donors. As with any pilot study, the small number of donors and their relatively narrow age range are potential limiting factors.The ability to measure RBF, and hence RPF, non-invasively, coupled with GFR measurement, allows calculation of FF, a biomarker that might provide a sensitive indicator of loss of renal reserve in potential donors.• Non-invasive MRI measured renal blood flow and calculated renal plasma flow. • Effect of nephrectomy on blood flow and filtration in donors is presented. • Calculated filtration fraction may be a useful new kidney biomarker.},

Using renal DCE-MRI and a three-compartment model analysis, this work evaluated the effect two different AIFs, derived from variable sized ROIs in the aorta, has on calculating DCE-MRI renal perfusion and filtration values in a group of healthy adult volunteers who underwent two consecutive renal DCE-MRI studies.Fifteen healthy volunteers underwent two DCE-MRI studies under similar physiological conditions. Oblique-coronal DCE-MRI data volumes were acquired on a 1.5 T Siemens Avanto scanner with a 3D-FLASH pulse-sequence (TE/TR=0.53/1.63 ms, flip angle=17 degrees , acquisition matrix=128 x 104 voxels, strong fat saturation, PAT factor=2 (GRAPPA) and 400 mm x 325 mm FOV).

During the MR scan a dose of 0.05 m mol (0.1 mL)kg(-1) body weight of dimeglumine gadopentetate (Magnevist) was injected intravenously (2 mLs(-1) injection rate), followed by a 15 mL saline flush at the same rate, using a MR-compatible automated injector (Spectris). Two AIFs were defined for each volunteer by drawing two ROIs in the aorta for each study. Renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) values were then calculated for each of the AIFs using a modified Tofts Renal Model (TRM). Both renal perfusion and GFR were expressed in mL min(-1)100 mL(-1) of tissue.Inter-individual reproducibility tests for renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate showed that the size of AIF ROIs significantly affects calculated values of perfusion and GFR (p-values <0.02). No significant differences were observed when comparing perfusion and GFR values in the same volunteer between scans performed on different days (p-values >0.22). From our study we conclude that while DCE-MRI derived indices of renal function are reproducible in the same individual when imaged on different days, the size of the aortic ROI and hence the AIF has a significant influence on calculated renal perfusion and GFR values. Currently there is no accepted standard for drawing the aortic ROI and no standardized approach for the AIF definition in renal DCE-MRI studies.},

  Abstract                 = {To investigate the reproducibility of arterial spin labelling (ASL) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and quantitatively compare these techniques for the measurement of renal blood flow (RBF).Sixteen healthy volunteers were examined on two different occasions. ASL was performed using a multi-TI FAIR labelling scheme with a segmented 3D-GRASE imaging module. DCE MRI was performed using a 3D-FLASH pulse sequence. A Bland-Altman analysis was used to assess repeatability of each technique, and determine the degree of correspondence between the two methods.The overall mean cortical renal blood flow (RBF) of the ASL group was 263 ± 41 ml min(-1) [100 ml tissue](-1), and using DCE MRI was 287 ± 70 ml min(-1) [100 ml tissue](-1). The group coefficient of variation (CVg) was 18 \% for ASL and 28 \% for DCE-MRI. Repeatability studies showed that ASL was more reproducible than DCE with CVgs of 16 \% and 25 \% for ASL and DCE respectively. Bland-Altman analysis comparing the two techniques showed a good agreement.The repeated measures analysis shows that the ASL technique has better reproducibility than DCE-MRI. Difference analysis shows no significant difference between the RBF values of the two techniques.Reliable non-invasive monitoring of renal blood flow is currently clinically unavailable. Renal arterial spin labelling MRI is robust and repeatable. Renal dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI is robust and repeatable. ASL blood flow values are similar to those obtained using DCE-MRI.},

  Abstract                 = {Spoiled gradient echo pulse (SPGRE) sequences are commonly used in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) studies to measure the contrast agent concentration in a tissue of interest over time. However, due to improper tuning of the SPGRE parameters, concentration uncertainty can be very high, even at high signal-to-noise ratio in the MR measurement. In this work, an optimization procedure is proposed for selecting the optimal value of the SPGRE-flip angle FA(opt), given the expected concentration range. The optimization condition ensures that every concentration in the assumed range has the lowest possible uncertainty. By decoupling the R(1)- and R*(2)-effects caused by the presence of the contrast agent, a contour plot has been generated from which FA(opt) can be read off for any study design. Investigation of ten recent DCE-MRI studies showed that improper flip angle selection unnecessarily increases the concentration uncertainty, up to 742\% and 72\% on average for the typical physiological concentration ranges of 0-2 mM in tumour tissue and 0-10 mM in blood, respectively. Simulations show that the reduced noise levels on the concentration curves, observed at the optimal flip angle, effectively increase the precision of the kinetic parameters estimates (up to 82\% for K(trans), 82\% for ν(e) and 92\% for ν(p) in the case of an individually measured arterial input function (AIF), up to 53\% for K(trans), 59\% for ν(e) and 67\% for ν(p) in the case of a standard AIF). In vivo experiments confirm the potential of flip angle optimization to increase the reproducibility of the kinetic parameter estimates.},

  Abstract                 = {For pharmacokinetic modeling of tissue physiology, there is great interest in measuring the arterial input function (AIF) from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using paramagnetic contrast agents. Due to relaxation effects, the measured signal is a nonlinear function of the injected contrast agent concentration and depends on sequence parameters, system calibration, and time-of-flight effects, making it difficult to accurately measure the AIF during the first pass. Paramagnetic contrast agents also affect susceptibility and modify the magnetic field in proportion to their concentration. This information is contained in the MR signal phase which is discarded in a typical image reconstruction. However, quantifying AIF through contrast agent susceptibility induced phase changes is made difficult by the fact that the induced magnetic field is nonlocal and depends upon the contrast agent spatial distribution and thus on organ and vessel shapes. In this article, the contrast agent susceptibility was quantified through inversion of magnetic field shifts using a piece-wise constant model. Its feasibility is demonstrated by a determination of the AIF from the susceptibility-induced field changes of an intravenous bolus. After in vitro validation, a time-resolved two-dimensional (2D) gradient echo scan, triggered to diastole, was performed in vivo on the aortic arch during a bolus injection of 0.1 mmol/kg Gd-DTPA. An approximate geometrical model of the aortic arch constructed from the magnitude images was used to calculate the spatial variation of the field associated with the bolus. In 14 subjects, Gd concentration curves were measured dynamically (one measurement per heart beat) and indirectly validated by independent 2D cine phase contrast flow rate measurements. Flow rate measurements using indicator conservation with this novel quantitative susceptibility imaging technique were found to be in good agreement with those obtained from the cine phase contrast measurements in all subjects. Contrary to techniques that rely on intensity, the accuracy of this signal phase based method is insensitive to factors influencing signal intensity such as flip angle, coil sensitivity, relaxation changes, and time-of-flight effects extending the range of pulse sequences and contrast doses for which quantitative DCE-MRI can be applied.},

However, a precise real-time correction for motion is fundamental in abdominal organs to ensure an optimal treatment dose associated with a limited toxicity in nearby organs at risk. This paper proposes a real-time direct principal component analysis (PCA)-based technique which offers a robust approach for motion estimation of abdominal organs and allows correcting motion related artifacts. The PCA was used to detect spatio-temporal coherences of the periodic organ motion in a learning step. During the interventional procedure, physiological contributions were characterized quantitatively using a small set of parameters. A coarse-to-fine resolution scheme is proposed to improve the stability of the algorithm and afford a predictable constant latency of 80 ms. The technique was evaluated on 12 free-breathing volunteers and provided an improved real-time description of motion related to both breathing and cardiac cycles. A reduced learning step of 10 s was sufficient without any need for patient-specific control parameters, rendering the method suitable for clinical use.},

Methods were compared under a number of experimental conditions.In synthetic data, joint estimation led to statistically significant improvements in the accuracy of estimated parameters in 30 of 42 conditions (improvements between 1.8\% and 49\%). Reduced accuracy was observed in 7 of the remaining 12 conditions. Significant improvements in precision were observed in 35 of 42 conditions (between 4.7\% and 50\%). In clinical data, significant improvements in precision were observed in 18 of 21 conditions (between 4.6\% and 38\%).Accuracy and precision of DCE-MRI parameter estimates are improved when signal models are fit jointly rather than sequentially.

Eight healthy volunteers underwent 2D multi-gradient echo MR imaging at 1.5 T and 3.0 T. Parametrical T(2) relaxation time maps were computed and average T(2) was measured in regions of interest placed in the renal medulla and cortex. The largest T(2) changes were measured in the renal medulla, with a relative ∆T(2) of 33.8 ± 22.0\% (right medulla) and 34.7 ± 17.6\% (left medulla) as compared to room air for oxygen breathing (p > 0.01), and 53.8 ± 23.9\% and 53.5 ± 33.9\% (p < 0.01) for carbogen breathing, respectively at 3 T. At 1.5 T, the corresponding values were 13.7 ± 18.5\% and 24.1 ± 17.1\% (p < 0.01) for oxygen breathing and 23.9 ± 17.2\% and 38.9 ± 37.6\% (p < 0.01) for carbogen breathing. As a result, we showed that renal medullary T(2) times responded strongly to inhalation of hyperoxic gases, which may be attributed to the hypoxic condition of the medulla and subsequent reduction in deoxyhemoglobin.},

  Abstract                 = {Nuclear medicine and MRI provide information about renal perfusion, function (glomerular filtration rate), and drainage. Some tracers that are used in nuclear medicine (technetium-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid ([(99m)Tc-DTPA] and (51)chromium-EDTA) and some contrast media (CM) that are used for MRI (gadolinium-DTPA for instance) share the same pharmacokinetic properties, though, detection techniques are different (low-spatial resolution 2-dimensional projection with a good concentration-to-signal linearity for nuclear medicine and high-resolution 3-dimensional localization with nonlinear behavior for MRI). Thus, though based on the same principles, the methods are not the same and they provide somewhat different information. Many MRI perfusion studies have been conducted; some of them were compared with nuclear medicine with no good agreement. Phase contrast can reliably assess global renal blood flow but not perfusion at a tissular level. Arterial spin labeling has not proven to be a reliable tool to measure renal perfusion. Techniques using CM theoretically can assess perfusion at the tissular level, but they have not proven to be precise. To assess renal function, many models have been proposed. Some MRI techniques using CM, both semiquantitative (Patlak) and quantitative, have shown ability to roughly assess relative function. Some quantitative methods (Annet's and Lee's methods) have even showed that they could roughly estimate absolute renal function, with better results than estimated glomerular filtration rate. Quantification of drainage has not been much studied using MRI.},

  Abstract                 = {Functional blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging is a powerful tool to assess renal function, but BOLD analysis using T2* image differentiation of cortex and medulla is laborious and prone to errors. We developed and validated an alternative compartmental analysis method to differentiate renal cortical and medullary BOLD relaxivity index, R2*. This method uses whole-kidney regions of interest (ROI), thus eliminating the need for anatomic cortical and medullary definition.Nine hypertensive patients and 11 domestic pigs, some with renal artery stenosis, were studied using BOLD MRI before and after injection of furosemide, which reduces medullary oxygen consumption. R2* in cortex and medulla estimated before and after furosemide with the compartmental method were compared with those obtained using conventional T2* image selection for ROI (manual ROI method), and a reference method with ROIs obtained using contrast-enhanced computerized tomography images were coregistered for the same kidneys.All 3 methods provided similar cortical R2* values, but the Bland-Altman methods' agreement confidence intervals of the reference and compartmental-derived medullary R2* response in humans and pigs were smaller than those in the manual ROI method. Operator dependency in swine was lower in the compartmental method, and its estimates of variation were almost 1/3 compared with the manual ROI method.The new compartmental method, which is less labor intensive than the conventional method, provides comparable and less variable kidney R2* estimations, especially in renal medulla. This method could be useful for analysis of kidney BOLD data.},

  Abstract                 = {Because of its noninvasive nature and provision of quantitative measures of a wide variety of physiologic parameters, functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows great potential for research and clinical applications. Over the past decade, application of functional MRI extended beyond detection of cerebral activity, and techniques for abdominal functional MRI evolved. Assessment of renal perfusion, glomerular filtration, interstitial diffusion, and parenchymal oxygenation turned this modality into an essential research and potentially diagnostic tool. Variations in many renal physiologic markers can be detected using functional MRI before morphologic changes become evident in anatomic magnetic resonance images. Moreover, the framework of functional MRI opened a window of opportunity to develop novel pathophysiologic markers. This article reviews applications of some well validated functional MRI techniques, including perfusion, diffusion-weighted imaging, and blood oxygen level-dependent MRI, as well as some emerging new techniques such as magnetic resonance elastography, which might evolve into clinically useful tools.},

  Abstract                 = {Mathematical models of water and solute transport in the kidney have significantly expanded our understanding of renal function in both health and disease. This review describes recent theoretical developments and emphasizes the relevance of model findings to major unresolved questions and controversies. These include the fundamental processes by which urine is concentrated in the inner medulla, the ultrastructural basis of proteinuria, irregular flow oscillation patterns in spontaneously hypertensive rats, and the mechanisms underlying the hypotensive effects of thiazides. Macroscopic models of water, NaCl, and urea transport in populations of nephrons have served to test, confirm, or refute a number of hypotheses related to the urine concentrating mechanism. Other macroscopic models focus on the mechanisms, role, and irregularities of renal hemodynamic control and on the regulation of renal oxygenation. At the mesoscale, models of glomerular filtration have yielded significant insight into the ultrastructural basis underlying a number of disorders. At the cellular scale, models of epithelial solute transport and pericyte Ca2+ signaling are being used to elucidate transport pathways and the effects of hormones and drugs. Areas where further theoretical progress is conditional on experimental advances are also identified.},

  Abstract                 = {The objective of our study was to investigate whether dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) can detect differences and potential adaption in single-kidney parenchymal volume, blood flow, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and filtration fraction in the remaining kidney of healthy donors compared with nondonors. Further, we evaluated the agreement in donor GFRs measured using DCE-MRI versus serum clearance of iohexol.Twenty living kidney donors and 20 healthy control subjects underwent DCE-MRI and iohexol GFR. Renal parenchymal volume was assessed from maximum-signal-intensity maps. Single-kidney MRI measurements of blood flow and GFR were derived from parenchymal signal intensity-time curves fitted to a two-compartment filtration model. The Student t test, Pearson correlation coefficient, mean differences, and limits of agreement were applied to analyze MRI measurements between groups and agreement with iohexol GFR.MRI findings showed significantly higher blood flow (difference in mean values of donors vs control subjects, 54\%; p = 0.001), GFR (78\%, p < 0.0001), and renal parenchymal volume (65\%, p < 0.0001) in the single kidney of donors compared with the single kidney of healthy control subjects. In the donors, a proportional increase in blood flow and GFR resulted in a comparable filtration fraction, as was observed in the control subjects. Significant correlations were found between MRI-derived GFR and parenchymal volume (p < 0.0016) as well as with iohexol GFR (p < 0.0001). The mean difference between MRI-derived GFR and iohexol GFR was 14.0 mL/min, and the limits of agreement between MRI-derived GFR and iohexol GFR were -24.1 and 52.1 mL/min.DCE-MRI-derived values for single-kidney function and volume in kidney donors were significantly higher than those in control subjects and suggest a future potential benefit of DCE-MRI for diagnostic and prognostic structural and functional assessments in living kidney donors.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to compare two 3D dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI measurement techniques for MR renography, a radial k-space weighted image contrast (KWIC) sequence and a cartesian FLASH sequence, in terms of intrasubject differences in estimates of renal functional parameters and image quality characteristics. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Ten healthy volunteers underwent repeated breath-hold KWIC and FLASH sequence examinations with temporal resolutions of 2.5 and 2.8 seconds, respectively. A two-compartment model was used to estimate MRI-derived perfusion parameters and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The latter was compared with the iohexol GFR and the estimated GFR. Image quality was assessed using a visual grading characteristic analysis of relevant image quality criteria and signal-to-noise ratio calculations. RESULTS. Perfusion estimates from FLASH were closer to literature reference values than were the KWIC sequences. In relation to the iohexol GFR (mean [± SD], 103 ± 11 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), KWIC produced significant underestimations and larger bias in GFR values (mean, 70 ± 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2); bias = -33.2 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) compared with the FLASH GFR (110 ± 29 mL/min/1.73 m(2); bias = 6.4 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). KWIC was statistically significantly (p < 0.005) more impaired by artifacts than was FLASH (AUC = 0.18). The average signal-enhancement ratio (delta ratio) in the cortex was significantly lower for KWIC (delta ratio = 0.99) than for FLASH (delta ratio = 1.40). Other visually graded image quality characteristics and signal-to-noise ratio measurements were not statistically significantly different. CONCLUSION. Using the same postprocessing scheme and pharmacokinetic model, FLASH produced more accurate perfusion and filtration parameters than did KWIC compared with clinical reference methods. Our data suggest an apparent relationship between image quality characteristics and the degree of stability in the numeric model-based renal function estimates.},

  Abstract                 = {Acute rejection is the most common reason of graft failure after kidney transplantation, and early detection is crucial to survive the transplanted kidney function. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for the automatic classification of normal and acute rejection transplants from Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI). The proposed algorithm consists of three main steps; the first step isolates the kidney from the surrounding anatomical structures by evolving a deformable model based on two density functions; the first function describes the distribution of the gray level inside and outside the kidney region and the second function describes the prior shape of the kidney. In the second step, a new nonrigid registration approach is employed to account for the motion of the kidney due to patient breathing. To validate our registration approach, we use a simulation of deformations based on biomechanical modelling of the kidney tissue using the finite element method (F.E.M.). Finally, the perfusion curves that show the transportation of the contrast agent into the tissue are obtained from the cortex and used in the classification of normal and acute rejection transplants. Applications of the proposed approach yield promising results that would, in the near future, replace the use of current technologies such as nuclear imaging and ultrasonography, which are not specific enough to determine the type of kidney dysfunction.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel shape based segmentation approach is proposed by modifying the external energy component of a deformable model. The proposed external energy component depends not only on the gray level of the images but also on the shape information which is obtained from the signed distance maps of objects in a given data set. The gray level distribution and the signed distance map of the points inside and outside the object of interest are accurately estimated by modelling the empirical density function with a linear combination of discrete Gaussians (LCDG) with positive and negative components. Experimental results on the segmentation of the kidneys from low-contrast DCE-MRI and on the segmentation of the ventricles from brain MRI's show how the approach is accurate in segmenting 2-D and 3-D data sets. The 2D results for the kidney segmentation have been validated by a radiologist and the 3D results of the ventricle segmentation have been validated with a geometrical phantom.},

  Abstract                 = {Renal blood flow, local tissue perfusion and blood oxygen content are the major determinants of oxygen delivery to kidney tissue. Arterial pressure and segmental vascular resistance influence kidney oxygen consumption through effects on glomerular filtration rate and sodium reabsorption. Diffusive shunting of oxygen from arteries to veins in the cortex and from descending to ascending vasa recta in the medulla limits oxygen delivery to renal tissue. Oxygen shunting depends on the vascular network, renal haemodynamics and kidney oxygen consumption. Consequently, the impact of changes in renal haemodynamics on tissue oxygenation cannot necessarily be predicted intuitively and, instead, requires the integrative approach offered by computational modelling and multiple measuring modalities. Tissue hypoxia is a hallmark of acute kidney injury (AKI) arising from multiple initiating insults, including ischaemia-reperfusion injury, radiocontrast administration, cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, shock and sepsis. Its pathophysiology is defined by inflammation and/or ischaemia resulting in alterations in renal tissue oxygenation, nitric oxide bioavailability and oxygen radical homeostasis. This sequence of events appears to cause renal microcirculatory dysfunction, which may then be exacerbated by the inappropriate use of therapies common in peri-operative medicine, such as fluid resuscitation. The development of new ways to prevent and treat AKI requires an integrative approach that considers not just the molecular mechanisms underlying failure of filtration and tissue damage, but also the contribution of haemodynamic factors that determine kidney oxygenation. The development of bedside monitors allowing continuous surveillance of renal haemodynamics, oxygenation and function should facilitate better prevention, detection and treatment of AKI.},

  Abstract                 = {Alterations in renal microperfusion play an important role in the development of acute kidney injury with long-term consequences. Here we used contrast-enhanced ultrasonography as a novel method for depicting intrarenal distribution of blood flow. After infusion of microbubble contrast agent, bubbles were collapsed in the kidney and postbubble destruction refilling was measured in various regions of the kidney. Local perfusion was monitored in vivo at 15, 30, 45, 60 minutes and 24 hours after 28 minutes of bilateral ischemia in 12 mice. High-resolution, pixel-by-pixel analysis was performed on each imaging clip using customized software, yielding parametric perfusion maps of the kidney, representing relative blood volume in each pixel. These perfusion maps revealed that outer medullary perfusion decreased disproportionately to the reduction in the cortical and inner medullary perfusion after ischemia. Outer medullary perfusion was significantly decreased by 69\% at 60 minutes postischemia and remained significantly less (40\%) than preischemic levels at 24 hours postischemia. Thus, contrast-enhanced ultrasonography with high-resolution parametric perfusion maps can monitor changes in renal microvascular perfusion in space and time in mice. This novel technique can be translated to clinical use in man.},

A considerable problem for arterial spin labeling methods, which are based on sequential subtraction, is the movement of the kidneys due to respiratory motion between acquisitions. The effects of breathing strategy (free, respiratory-triggered and breath hold) are studied and the use of background suppression is investigated. The application of movement correction by image registration is assessed and perfusion rates are measured. Postacquisition image realignment is shown to improve visual quality and subsequent perfusion quantification. Using such correction, data can be collected from free breathing alone, without the need for a good respiratory trace and in the shortest overall acquisition time, advantageous for patient comfort. The addition of background suppression to arterial spin labeling data is shown to reduce the perfusion signal-to-noise ratio and underestimate perfusion.},

Cortical and medullary regions of interest (ROIs) were located to obtain the corresponding values of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and the fractional anisotropy (FA). The mean values of the ADC and FA, for each ROI site, were obtained in each group and were compared. Furthermore, the correlations between the diffusion parameters and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were determined.In both the normal and affected kidneys, we obtained the cortico-medullary difference of the ADC and the FA values. The FA value in the medulla was significantly lower (P = 0.0149) in patients with renal function impairment as compared to patients with normal renal function. A direct correlation between DTI parameters and the eGFR was not found. Tractography visualised disruption of the regular arrangement of the tracts in patient with renal function alteration.DTI could be a useful tool in the evaluation of chronic kidney disease and, in particular, the medullary FA value seems to be the main parameter for assessing renal damage.• Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (MRDTI) provides new information about renal problems. • DTI allows non-invasive repeatable evaluation of the renal parenchyma, without contrast media. • DTI could become useful in the management of chronic parenchymal disease. • DTI seems more appropriate for renal evaluation than diffusion-weighted imaging.},

  Abstract                 = {This study introduces the use of 'error-category mapping' in the interpretation of pharmacokinetic (PK) model parameter results derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE-) MRI data. Eleven patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma were enrolled in a multiparametric study of the treatment effects of bevacizumab. For the purposes of the present analysis, DCE-MRI data from two identical pre-treatment examinations were analysed by application of the extended Tofts model (eTM), using in turn a model arterial input function (AIF), an individually-measured AIF and a sample-average AIF. PK model parameter maps were calculated. Errors in the signal-to-gadolinium concentration ([Gd]) conversion process and the model-fitting process itself were assigned to category codes on a voxel-by-voxel basis, thereby forming a colour-coded 'error-category map' for each imaged slice. These maps were found to be repeatable between patient visits and showed that the eTM converged adequately in the majority of voxels in all the tumours studied. However, the maps also clearly indicated sub-regions of low Gd uptake and of non-convergence of the model in nearly all tumours. The non-physical condition ve ≥ 1 was the most frequently indicated error category and appeared sensitive to the form of AIF used. This simple method for visualisation of errors in DCE-MRI could be used as a routine quality-control technique and also has the potential to reveal otherwise hidden patterns of failure in PK model applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Measurement of renal perfusion is a crucial part of measuring kidney function. Arterial spin labelling magnetic resonance imaging (ASL MRI) is a non-invasive method of measuring renal perfusion using magnetised blood as endogenous contrast. We studied the reproducibility of ASL MRI in normal volunteers.ASL MRI was performed in healthy volunteers on 2 occasions using a 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner with flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) perfusion preparation with a steady state free precession (True-FISP) pulse sequence. Kidney volume was measured from the scanned images. Routine serum and urine biochemistry were measured prior to MRI scanning.12 volunteers were recruited yielding 24 kidneys, with a mean participant age of 44.1 ± 14.6 years, blood pressure of 136/82 mmHg and chronic kidney disease epidemiology formula estimated glomerular filtration rate (CKD EPI eGFR) of 98.3 ± 15.1 ml/min/1.73 m2. Mean kidney volumes measured using the ellipsoid formula and voxel count method were 123.5 ± 25.5 cm3, and 156.7 ± 28.9 cm3 respectively. Mean kidney perfusion was 229 ± 41 ml/min/100 g and mean cortical perfusion was 327 ± 63 ml/min/100 g, with no significant differences between ASL MRIs. Mean absolute kidney perfusion calculated from kidney volume measured during the scan was 373 ± 71 ml/min. Bland Altman plots were constructed of the cortical and whole kidney perfusion measurements made at ASL MRIs 1 and 2. These showed good agreement between measurements, with a random distribution of means plotted against differences observed. The intra class correlation for cortical perfusion was 0.85, whilst the within subject coefficient of variance was 9.2\%. The intra class correlation for whole kidney perfusion was 0.86, whilst the within subject coefficient of variance was 7.1\%.ASL MRI at 3.0 Tesla provides a repeatable method of measuring renal perfusion in healthy subjects without the need for administration of exogenous compounds. We have established normal values for renal perfusion using ASL MRI in a cohort of healthy volunteers.},

  Abstract                 = {Fully automatic 3-D segmentation techniques for clinical applications or epidemiological studies have proven to be a very challenging task in the domain of medical image analysis. 3-D organ segmentation on magnetic resonance (MR) datasets requires a well-designed segmentation strategy due to imaging artifacts, partial volume effects, and similar tissue properties of adjacent tissues. We developed a 3-D segmentation framework for fully automatic kidney parenchyma volumetry that uses Bayesian concepts for probability map generation. The probability map quality is improved in a multistep refinement approach. An extended prior shape level set segmentation method is then applied on the refined probability maps. The segmentation quality is improved by incorporating an exterior cortex edge alignment technique using cortex probability maps. In contrast to previous approaches, we combine several relevant kidney parenchyma features in a sequence of segmentation techniques for successful parenchyma delineation on native MR datasets. Furthermore, the proposed method is able to recognize and exclude parenchymal cysts from the parenchymal volume. We analyzed four different quality measures showing better results for right parenchymal tissue than for left parenchymal tissue due to an incorporated liver part removal in the segmentation framework. The results show that the outer cortex edge alignment approach successfully improves the quality measures.},

  Abstract                 = {In epidemiological studies as well as in clinical practice the amount of produced medical image data strongly increased in the last decade. In this context organ segmentation in MR volume data gained increasing attention for medical applications. Especially in large-scale population-based studies organ volumetry is highly relevant requiring exact organ segmentation. Since manual segmentation is time-consuming and prone to reader variability, large-scale studies need automatized methods to perform organ segmentation. Fully automatic organ segmentation in native MR image data has proven to be a very challenging task. Imaging artifacts as well as inter- and intrasubject MR-intensity differences complicate the application of supervised learning strategies. Thus, we propose a modularized framework of a two-stepped probabilistic approach that generates subject-specific probability maps for renal parenchyma tissue, which are refined subsequently by using several, extended segmentation strategies. We present a three class-based support vector machine recognition system that incorporates Fourier descriptors as shape features to recognize and segment characteristic parenchyma parts. Probabilistic methods use the segmented characteristic parenchyma parts to generate high quality subject-specific parenchyma probability maps. Several refinement strategies including a final shape-based 3D level set segmentation technique are used in subsequent processing modules to segment renal parenchyma. Furthermore, our framework recognizes and excludes renal cysts from parenchymal volume, which is important to analyze renal functions. Volume errors and Dice coefficients show that our presented framework outperforms existing approaches.},

Normal cortical-to-medulla oxygenation gradients are preserved in many patients treated for several years with medical antihypertensive therapy without restoring renal blood flow. The current review is of particular interest as new methods have been applied to the analyses of BOLD MRI, opening the perspective of its wider utilization in clinical practice.Recent findings show that more severe vascular compromise ultimately overwhelms renal adaptive changes, leading to overt cortical hypoxia and expansion of medullary hypoxic zones. 'Fractional kidney hypoxia' method of analysis, developed as an alternative method of BOLD MRI analysis, avoids the assumption of discrete cortical and medullary values and decreases the bias related to operator selection of regions of interests.We believe that thoughtful application and analysis of BOLD MRI can provide critical insights into changes in renal function prior to the onset of irreversible renal injury and may identify patients most likely to gain from measures to reverse or repair disorders of tissue oxygenation.},

We also introduce nonlinear time series analysis methods and provide examples where these have advantages over linear methods. We review areas where these computational methods have found applications in nephrology ranging from basic physiology to health services research. Some examples include noninvasive assessment of autonomic function in patients with chronic kidney disease, dialysis-dependent renal failure and renal transplantation. Time series models and analysis methods have been utilized in the characterization of mechanisms of renal autoregulation and to identify the interaction between different rhythms of nephron pressure flow regulation. They have also been used in the study of trends in health care delivery. Time series are everywhere in nephrology and analyzing them can lead to valuable knowledge discovery.

  Abstract                 = {Magnetic resonance imaging with arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a noninvasive approach to measure organ perfusion. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility of ASL kidney perfusion measurements with semiautomatic segmentation, which allows separate quantification of cortical and medullary perfusion.The right kidneys of 14 healthy volunteers were examined 6 times on 2 occasions (3 times at each occasion). There was a 10-minute pause between each examination and a 14-day interval between the 2 occasions. Cortical, medullary, and whole kidney parenchymal perfusion was determined with customized semiautomatic segmentation software. Coefficient of variances (CVs) and intraclass correlations (ICCs) were calculated.Mean whole, cortical, and medullary kidney perfusion was 307.26 ± 25.65, 337.10 ± 34.83, and 279.61 ± 26.73 mL/min/100 g, respectively. On session 1, mean perfusion for the whole kidney, cortex, and medulla was 307.08 ± 26.91, 336.79 ± 36.54, and 279.60 ± 27.81 mL/min/100 g, respectively, and on session 2, 307.45 ± 24.65, 337.41 ± 33.48, and 279.61 ± 25.94 mL/min/100 g, respectively (P > 0.05; R = 0.60/0.59/0.54). For whole, cortical, and medullary kidney perfusion, the total ICC/CV were 0.97/3.43 ± 0.86\%, 0.97/4.19 ± 1.33\%, and 0.96/4.12 ± 1.36\%, respectively. Measurements did not differ significantly and showed a very good correlation (P > 0.05; R = 0.75/0.76/0.65).ASL kidney measurements combined with operator-independent semiautomatic segmentation revealed high correlation and low variance of cortical, medullary, and whole kidney perfusion.},

The degree of contrast enhancement and the calibration-free quantification of gadolinium (Gd) concentration were evaluated among fast low-angle shot (FLASH), TSE, and CS-TSE acquisitions with multiple phantoms (0.1-6 mM). The kidney-feeding in vivo arterial input function (AIF) was measured at multiple administration doses (0.1-0.3 mmol/kg) to evaluate the benefit of CS-TSE for quantifying rapidly changing high Gd concentrations in C57BL/6 mice (n = 22).In phantom studies, both calibration-free and calibrated conversions estimated equivalent Gd concentrations for CS-TSE (scatterplot slope = 0.9801, r(2)  = 0.9998, P < 0.001). In in vivo studies, 4-fold higher temporal resolution (0.96 sec) of CS-TSE over the corresponding TSE enabled robust measurement of AIF first-pass peak and resulting peak enhancement with CS-TSE were observed, with 1.1439- and 2.1258-fold times higher than those with TSE and FLASH acquisitions, respectively, at the 0.1 mmol/kg dose. Calibration-free estimates of AIF peak concentration with CS-TSE were in good agreement with the calibrated approach at multiple administration doses (scatterplot slope = 0.7800, r(2)  = 0.8014, P < 0.001).Temporal resolution-improved CS-TSE provides practical subsecond (0.96s) calibration-free dynamic MR quantification of high Gd concentration.

Regularization of the segmentation is commonly performed using local image information causing the segmented image to be locally smooth or piecewise constant. A new spatial regularization method, incorporating non-local information, was developed and tested.Our spatial regularization method applies to feature space classification in multichannel images such as color images and MR image sequences. The spatial regularization involves local edge properties, region boundary minimization, as well as non-local similarities. The method is implemented in a discrete graph-cut setting allowing fast computations.The method was tested on multidimensional MRI recordings from human kidney and brain in addition to simulated MRI volumes.The proposed method successfully segment regions with both smooth and complex non-smooth shapes with a minimum of user interaction.},

  Abstract                 = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) imaging, has shown great potential in prostate cancer diagnosis and staging. In the current practice of DCE-MRI, diagnosis is based on quantitative parameters extracted from the series of T1-weighted images acquired after the injection of a contrast agent. To calculate these parameters, a pharmacokinetic model is fitted to the T1-weighted intensities. Most models make simplistic assumptions about the perfusion process. Moreover, these models require accurate estimation of the arterial input function, which is challenging. In this work we propose a data-driven approach to characterization of the prostate tissue that uses the time series of DCE T1-weighted images without pharmacokinetic modeling. This approach uses a number of model-free empirical parameters and also the principal component analysis (PCA) of the normalized T1-weighted intensities, as features for cancer detection from DCE MRI. The optimal set of principal components is extracted with sparse regularized regression through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). A support vector machine classifier was used with leave-one-patient-out cross validation to determine the ability of this set of features in cancer detection. Our data is obtained from patients prior to radical prostatectomy and the results are validated based on histological evaluation of the extracted specimens. Our results, obtained on 449 tissue regions from 16 patients, show that the proposed data-driven features outperform the traditional pharmacokinetic parameters with an area under ROC of 0.86 for LASSO-isolated PCA parameters, compared to 0.78 for pharmacokinetic parameters. This shows that our novel approach to the analysis of DCE data has the potential to improve the multiparametric MRI protocol for prostate cancer detection.},

  Abstract                 = {The leading cause of ESRD in the U.S. is diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Despite significant efforts to improve outcomes in DKD, the impact on disease progression has been disappointing. This has prompted clinicians and researchers to search for alternative approaches to identify persons at risk, and to search for more effective therapies to halt progression of DKD. Identification of novel therapies is critically dependent on a more comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology of DKD, specifically at the molecular level. A more expansive and exploratory view of DKD is needed to complement more traditional research approaches that have focused on single molecules.In recent years, sophisticated research methodologies have emerged within systems biology that should allow for a more comprehensive disease definition of DKD. Systems biology provides an inter-disciplinary approach to describe complex interactions within biological systems including how these interactions influence systems' functions and behaviors. Computational modeling of large, system-wide, quantitative data sets is used to generate molecular interaction pathways, such as metabolic and cell signaling networks.Importantly, interpretation of data generated by systems biology tools requires integration with enhanced clinical research data and validation using model systems. Such an integrative biological approach has already generated novel insights into pathways and molecules involved in DKD. In this review, we highlight recent examples of how combining systems biology with traditional clinical and model research efforts results in an integrative biology approach that has significantly added to the understanding of the complex pathophysiology of DKD.},

Although this ultrafiltrate is virtually free of plasma protein, the glomerular filter never clogs under physiological conditions. Upto today it is still not entirely resolved as to how the kidney accomplishes this extraordinary task. Most of the proposed models for glomerular filtration have not considered electrical effects.In micropuncture studies, we have directly measured an electrical field across the glomerular filtration barrier. This potential difference is most likely generated by forced passage of the ionic solution of the plasma across the charged glomerular filter ('electrokinetic potential'). As all plasma proteins are negatively charged, the electrical field across the glomerular filtration barrier is predicted to drive plasma proteins from the filter toward the capillary lumen by electrophoresis.In this review, we examine our novel model for glomerular filtration in more detail. We outline the physical mechanisms by which electrokinetic effects (streaming potentials) are generated. We investigate the potential impact of the electrical field on the passage of albumin across the glomerular filtration barrier. We review the mathematical heteroporous model including electrical effects and analyse a selection of experimental studies for indications that electrical effects influence glomerular permeability significantly.},

  Abstract                 = {Kidney diseases manifest in progressive loss of renal function, which ultimately leads to complete kidney failure. The mechanisms underlying the origins and progression of kidney diseases are not fully understood. Multiple factors involved in the pathogenesis of kidney diseases have made the traditional candidate gene approach of limited value toward full understanding of the molecular mechanisms of these diseases. A systems biology approach that integrates computational modeling with large-scale data gathering of the molecular changes could be useful in identifying the multiple interacting genes and their products that drive kidney diseases. Advances in biotechnology now make it possible to gather large data sets to characterize the role of the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome in kidney diseases. When combined with computational analyses, these experimental approaches will provide a comprehensive understanding of the underlying biological processes. Multiscale analysis that connects the molecular interactions and cell biology of different kidney cells to renal physiology and pathology can be utilized to identify modules of biological and clinical importance that are perturbed in disease processes. This integration of experimental approaches and computational modeling is expected to generate new knowledge that can help to identify marker sets to guide the diagnosis, monitor disease progression, and identify new therapeutic targets.},

  Abstract                 = {Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) can reduce renal blood flow, tissue oxygenation, and GFR. In this study, we sought to examine associations between renal hemodynamics and tissue oxygenation with single-kidney function, pressor hormones, and inflammatory biomarkers in patients with unilateral ARAS undergoing medical therapy alone or stent revascularization.Nonrandomized inpatient studies were performed in patients with unilateral ARAS (>60\% occlusion) before and 3 months after revascularization (n=10) or medical therapy (n=20) or patients with essential hypertension (n=32) under identical conditions. The primary study outcome was change in single-kidney GFR. Individual kidney hemodynamics and volume were measured using multidetector computed tomography. Tissue oxygenation (using R(2)* as a measure of deoxyhemoglobin) was determined by blood oxygen level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T. Renal vein neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and plasma renin activity were measured.Total GFR did not change over 3 months in either group, but the stenotic kidney (STK) GFR rose over time in the stent compared with the medical group (+2.2[-1.8 to 10.5] versus -5.3[-7.3 to -0.3] ml/min; P=0.03). Contralateral kidney (CLK) GFR declined in the stent group (43.6±19.7 to 36.6±19.5 ml/min; P=0.03). Fractional tissue hypoxia fell in the STK (fraction R(2)* >30/s: 22.1\%±20\% versus 14.9\%±18.3\%; P<0.01) after stenting. Renal vein biomarkers correlated with the degree of hypoxia in the STK: NGAL(r=0.3; P=0.01) and MCP-1(r=0.3; P=0.02; more so after stenting). Renal vein NGAL was inversely related to renal blood flow in the STK (r=-0.65; P<0.001). Biomarkers were highly correlated between STK and CLK, NGAL (r=0.94; P<0.001), and MCP-1 (r=0.96; P<0.001).These results showed changes over time in single-kidney GFR that were not evident in parameters of total GFR. Furthermore, they delineate the relationship of measurable tissue hypoxia within the STK and markers of inflammation in human ARAS. Renal vein NGAL and MCP-1 indicated persistent interactions between the ischemic kidney and both CLK and systemic levels of inflammatory cytokines.},

Traditionally, co-registration, segmentation, and pharmacokinetic modeling have been applied sequentially as separate processing steps. In this paper, a combined 4D model for simultaneous registration and segmentation of the whole kidney is presented. To demonstrate the model in numerical experiments, we used normalized gradients as data term in the registration and a Mahalanobis distance from the time courses of the segmented regions to a training set for supervised segmentation. By applying this framework to an input consisting of 4D image time series, we conduct simultaneous motion correction and two-region segmentation into kidney and background. The potential of the new approach is demonstrated on real DCE-MRI data from ten healthy volunteers.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic MR image recordings (DCE-MRI) of moving organs using bolus injections create two different types of dynamics in the images: (i) spatial motion artifacts due to patient movements, breathing and physiological pulsations that we want to counteract and (ii) signal intensity changes during contrast agent wash-in and wash-out that we want to preserve. Proper image registration is needed to counteract the motion artifacts and for a reliable assessment of physiological parameters. In this work we present a partial differential equation-based method for deformable multimodal image registration using normalized gradients and the Fourier transform to solve the Euler-Lagrange equations in a multilevel hierarchy. This approach is particularly well suited to handle the motion challenges in DCE-MRI time series, being validated on ten DCE-MRI datasets from the moving kidney. We found that both normalized gradients and mutual information work as high-performing cost functionals for motion correction of this type of data. Furthermore, we demonstrated that normalized gradients have improved performance compared to mutual information as assessed by several performance measures. We conclude that normalized gradients can be a viable alternative to mutual information regarding registration accuracy, and with promising clinical applications to DCE-MRI recordings from moving organs.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (DCE-CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) are functional imaging techniques. They aim to characterise the microcirculation by applying the principles of tracer-kinetic analysis to concentration-time curves measured in individual image pixels. In this paper, we review the basic principles of DCE-MRI and DCE-CT, with a specific emphasis on the use of tracer-kinetic modeling. The aim is to provide an introduction to the field for a broader audience of pharmacokinetic modelers. In a first part, we first review the key aspects of data acquisition in DCE-CT and DCE-MRI, including a review of basic measurement strategies, a discussion on the relation between signal and concentration, and the problem of measuring reference data in arterial blood. In a second part, we define the four main parameters that can be measured with these techniques and review the most common tracer-kinetic models that are used in this field. We first discuss the models for the capillary bed and then define the most general four-parameter models used today: the two-compartment exchange model, the tissue-homogeneity model, the "adiabatic approximation to the tissue-homogeneity model" and the distributed-parameter model. In simpler tissue types or when the data quality is inadequate to resolve all the features of the more complex models, it is often necessary to resort to simpler models, which are special cases of the general models and hence have less parameters. We discuss the most common of these special cases, i.e. the uptake models, the extended Tofts model, and the one-compartment model. Models for two specific tissue types, liver and kidney, are discussed separately. We conclude with a review of practical aspects of DCE-CT and DCE-MRI data analysis, including the problem of identifying a suitable model for any given data set, and a brief discussion of the application of tracer-kinetic modeling in the context of drug development. Here, an important application of DCE techniques is the derivation of quantitative imaging biomarkers for the assessment of effects of targeted therapeutics on tumors.},

However, there may be intrinsic information in the amplitudes of these fluctuations. We investigated the possibility of using the amplitude of spontaneous BOLD signal fluctuations as a biomarker for cerebral vasomotor reactivity. We compared the coefficient of variation (CV) of the time series (defined as the temporal standard deviation of the time series divided by the mean signal intensity) in two populations: 1) Ten young healthy adults and 2) Ten hypertensive elderly subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We found a statistically significant increase (P<0.01) in the CV values for the CKD patients compared with the young healthy adults in both gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM). The difference was independent of the exact segmentation method, became more significant after correcting for physiological signals using RETROICOR, and mainly arose from very low frequency components of the BOLD signal fluctuation (f<0.025 Hz). Furthermore, there was a strong relationship between WM and GM signal fluctuation CV's (R(2)= 0.87) in individuals, with a ratio of about 1:3. These results suggest that amplitude of the spontaneous BOLD signal fluctuations may be used to assess the cerebrovascular reactivity mechanisms and provide valuable information about variations with age and different disease states.},

  Abstract                 = {Kidney disease represents a leading cause of morbidity, with high healthcare costs. The existing methods used to evaluate renal function include measures of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), yet the clinical methods are generally inaccurate and poorly reproducible. A method that improves measures of renal function as part of a comprehensive examination that also evaluates renal structure represents an important unmet clinical need. Use of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the evaluation of renal function has been undergoing development by several groups. The methodology has been referred to as MR Urography (MRU) or MR Nephro-urography (MRNU). MRU/MRNU shows promise for providing new insights into the evaluation of renal structure and function in relation to important disease processes, including urinary obstruction and in relation to renal transplantation. MRU/MRNU generally requires consideration of imaging acquisition technique, image postprocessing strategies, and subsequent kinetic mathematical modeling of the data in reference to specific physiological renal processes, such as renal blood flow and GFR. Here we review the specifics of proposed methods in light of the overall strengths and limitations of each of these strategies. The overall objective is to provide a roadmap for future developments in this evolving field of novel MRI applications.},

  Abstract                 = {To present an image registration method for renal blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) measurements that enables semiautomatic assessment of parenchymal and medullary R2* changes under a functional challenge.In a series of breath-hold acquisitions, three-dimensional data were acquired initially for prospective image registration of subsequent BOLD measurements. An algorithm for kidney alignment for BOLD renal imaging (KALIBRI) was implemented to detect the positions of the left and right kidney so that the kidneys were acquired in the subsequent BOLD measurement at consistent anatomical locations. Residual in-plane distortions were corrected retrospectively so that semiautomatic dynamic R2* measurements of the renal cortex and medulla become feasible. KALIBRI was tested in six healthy volunteers during a series of BOLD experiments, which included a 600- to 1000-mL water challenge.Prospective image registration and BOLD imaging of each kidney was achieved within a total measurement time of about 17 s, enabling its execution within a single breath-hold. KALIBRI improved the registration by up to 35\% as found with mutual information measures. In four volunteers, a medullary R2* decrease of up to 40\% was observed after water ingestion.KALIBRI improves the quality of two-dimensional time-resolved renal BOLD MRI by aligning local renal anatomy, which allows for consistent R2* measurements over many breath-holds.

  Abstract                 = {Fitting tracer kinetic models using linear methods is much faster than using their nonlinear counterparts, although this comes often at the expense of reduced accuracy and precision. The aim of this study was to derive and compare the performance of the linear compartmental tissue uptake (CTU) model with its nonlinear version with respect to their percentage error and precision.The linear and nonlinear CTU models were initially compared using simulations with varying noise and temporal sampling. Subsequently, the clinical applicability of the linear model was demonstrated on 14 patients with locally advanced cervical cancer examined with dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.Simulations revealed equal percentage error and precision when noise was within clinical achievable ranges (contrast-to-noise ratio >10). The linear method was significantly faster than the nonlinear method, with a minimum speedup of around 230 across all tested sampling rates. Clinical analysis revealed that parameters estimated using the linear and nonlinear CTU model were highly correlated (ρ ≥ 0.95).The linear CTU model is computationally more efficient and more stable against temporal downsampling, whereas the nonlinear method is more robust to variations in noise. The two methods may be used interchangeably within clinical achievable ranges of temporal sampling and noise.

Second, to compare MRI measurements of Vc using the semiautomatic segmentation method with a manual segmentation method. Third, to evaluate the reproducibility of Vc measurements.A total of 22 pigs, 13 with healthy kidneys and nine with diseased kidneys, underwent MRI with two non-contrast-agent methods (MRI 100 x 900 and MRI 300 x 1100) and one contrast-agent method (MRI Gd). For each of these methods, Vc was estimated using semiautomatic (Vc(100 x 900), Vc(300 x 1100), and Vc(Gd)), as well as manual (Vc MANUAL) segmentation. Reference volumes were estimated by stereological means (Vc STEREOLOGY). MRI-derived volumes were compared with reference volumes using a two-tailed paired t-test, and variances between methods were visualized with Bland Altman plots. Reproducibilities were analyzed using covariance analysis.Neither measurements of Vc 100 x 900, Vc 300 x 1100, nor Vc Gd differed markedly from Vc STEREOLOGY using semiautomatic segmentation. Vc was comparable when semiautomatic and manual segmentations were performed at the same scan. Reproducibility of MRI estimated Vc values offered intra- and interindividual differences <5\%.Vc can in both healthy and diseased kidneys be measured accurately with MRI using both semiautomatic and manual segmentation, and measurements can be obtained with a high reproducibility. Measurements of Vc 100 x 900 may in the future become suitable in patients with chronic renal failure.},

  Abstract                 = {The development and implementation of quantitative imaging biomarkers has been hampered by the inconsistent and often incorrect use of terminology related to these markers. Sponsored by the Radiological Society of North America, an interdisciplinary group of radiologists, statisticians, physicists, and other researchers worked to develop a comprehensive terminology to serve as a foundation for quantitative imaging biomarker claims. Where possible, this working group adapted existing definitions derived from national or international standards bodies rather than invent new definitions for these terms. This terminology also serves as a foundation for the design of studies that evaluate the technical performance of quantitative imaging biomarkers and for studies of algorithms that generate the quantitative imaging biomarkers from clinical scans. This paper provides examples of research studies and quantitative imaging biomarker claims that use terminology consistent with these definitions as well as examples of the rampant confusion in this emerging field. We provide recommendations for appropriate use of quantitative imaging biomarker terminological concepts. It is hoped that this document will assist researchers and regulatory reviewers who examine quantitative imaging biomarkers and will also inform regulatory guidance. More consistent and correct use of terminology could advance regulatory science, improve clinical research, and provide better care for patients who undergo imaging studies.},

  Abstract                 = {The objective was to develop a novel and automated comprehensive framework for the non-invasive identification and classification of kidney non-rejection and acute rejection transplants using 2D dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). The proposed approach consists of four steps. First, kidney objects are segmented from the surrounding structures with a geometric deformable model. Second, a non-rigid registration approach is employed to account for any local kidney deformation. In the third step, the cortex of the kidney is extracted in order to determine dynamic agent delivery, since it is the cortex that is primarily affected by the perfusion deficits that underlie the pathophysiology of acute rejection. Finally, we use an analytical function-based model to fit the dynamic contrast agent kinetic curves in order to determine possible rejection candidates. Five features that map the data from the original data space to the feature space are chosen with a k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) classifier to distinguish between acute rejection and non-rejection transplants. Our study includes 50 transplant patients divided into two groups: 27 patients with stable kidney function and the remainder with impaired kidney function. All of the patients underwent DCE-MRI, while the patients in the impaired group also underwent ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy. We extracted the kidney objects and the renal cortex from DCE-MRI for accurate medical evaluation with an accuracy of 0.97 ± 0.02 and 0.90 ± 0.03, respectively, using the Dice similarity metric. In a cohort of 50 participants, our framework classified all cases correctly (100\%) as rejection or non-rejection transplant candidates, which is comparable to the gold standard of biopsy but without the associated deleterious side-effects. Both the 95\% confidence interval (CI) statistic and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis document the ability to separate rejection and non-rejection groups. The average plateau (AP) signal magnitude and the gamma-variate model functional parameter α have the best individual discriminating characteristics.},

Thus, it is an important and well-established tool to reveal microvasculature and perfusion in various clinical applications. In the last three decades, a host of nonparametric and parametric models and methods have been developed in order to quantify the CA's perfusion into tissue and estimate perfusion-related parameters (indexes) from signal- or concentration-time curves. These indexes are widely used in various clinical applications for the detection, characterization, and therapy monitoring of different diseases.Promising theoretical findings and experimental results for the reviewed models and techniques in a variety of clinical applications suggest that DCE-MRI is a clinically relevant imaging modality, which can be used for early diagnosis of different diseases, such as breast and prostate cancer, renal rejection, and liver tumors.Both nonparametric and parametric approaches for DCE-MRI analysis possess the ability to quantify tissue perfusion.},

Ultrafiltered and reabsorbed sodium were determined from measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) and 24-hour urine collections.mGFR in patients was 37\% that of controls (36±15 vs 97±23 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P < 0.001), and reabsorbed sodium was 37\% that of controls (6.9 vs 19.1 mol/24 h; P < 0.001). Single-kidney patient renal artery blood flow was 72\% that of controls (319 vs 443 mL/min; P < 0.001). Glomerular filtration fraction was 9\% in patients and 18\% in controls (P < 0.001). Patients and controls had similar CR2* (13.4 vs 13.3 s(-1)) and medullary MR2* (26.4 vs 26.5 s(-1)) values. Linear regression analysis demonstrated no associations between R2* and renal artery blood flow or sodium absorption. Increasing arterial blood oxygen tension by breathing 100\% oxygen had very small effects on CR2*, but reduced MR2* in both groups.Only renal artery blood flow was determined and thus regional perfusion could not be related to CR2* or MR2*.In CKD, reductions of mGFR and reabsorbed sodium are more than double that of renal artery blood flow, whereas cortical and medullary oxygenation are within the range of healthy persons. Reduction in glomerular filtration fraction may prevent renal hypoxia in CKD.},

  Abstract                 = {Determine the reproducibility of renal artery blood flow (RABF) and blood-oxygenation level dependent (R2 *) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and healthy controls.RABF and R2 * were measured in 11 CKD patients and 9 controls twice with 1- to 2-week interval. R2 * in the cortex and medulla were determined after breathing atmospheric air and 100\% oxygen. Reproducibility was evaluated by coefficients of variation (CV), limits of agreements and intra-class coefficient calculated by variance components by maximum likelihood modeling.Single-kidney RABF (mL/min) for patients was: 170 ± 130 and 186 ± 137, and for controls: 365 ± 119 and 361 ± 107 (P < 0.05 versus patients), for first and second scans, respectively. RABF measurements were reproducible with a CV of 12.9\% and 8.3\% for patients and controls, respectively. Renal cortical R2 * was: 13.6 ± 0.9 and 13.5 ± 1.2 in patients (CV = 8.0\%), and 13.8 ± 1.6 and 14.0 ± 1.5 in controls (CV = 5.6\%), while medullary R2 *(s(-1) ) was: 26.9 ± 2.0 and 27.0 ± 4.0 (CV = 8.0\%) in patients, and 26.0 ± 2.4 and 26.1 ± 2.1 (CV = 3.6\%) in controls, for first and second scans, respectively. In both groups R2 * in medulla decreased after breathing 100\% oxygen.The reproducibility was high for both RABF and R2 * in patients and controls, particularly in the cortex. Inhalation of 100\% oxygen reduced medullary R2 *.},

  Abstract                 = {Our study developed a fully automated method for segmentation and volumetric measurements of kidneys from magnetic resonance images in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and assessed the performance of the automated method with the reference manual segmentation method.Study patients were selected from the Consortium for Radiologic Imaging Studies of Polycystic Kidney Disease. At the enrollment of the Consortium for Radiologic Imaging Studies of Polycystic Kidney Disease Study in 2000, patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease were between 15 and 46 years of age with relatively preserved GFRs. Our fully automated segmentation method was on the basis of a spatial prior probability map of the location of kidneys in abdominal magnetic resonance images and regional mapping with total variation regularization and propagated shape constraints that were formulated into a level set framework. T2-weighted magnetic resonance image sets of 120 kidneys were selected from 60 patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and divided into the training and test datasets. The performance of the automated method in reference to the manual method was assessed by means of two metrics: Dice similarity coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient of segmented kidney volume. The training and test sets were swapped for crossvalidation and reanalyzed.Successful segmentation of kidneys was performed with the automated method in all test patients. The segmented kidney volumes ranged from 177.2 to 2634 ml (mean, 885.4±569.7 ml). The mean Dice similarity coefficient ±SD between the automated and manual methods was 0.88±0.08. The mean correlation coefficient between the two segmentation methods for the segmented volume measurements was 0.97 (P<0.001 for each crossvalidation set). The results from the crossvalidation sets were highly comparable.We have developed a fully automated method for segmentation of kidneys from abdominal magnetic resonance images in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease with varying kidney volumes. The performance of the automated method was in good agreement with that of manual method.},

  Abstract                 = {Renal imaging examinations provide high-resolution information about the anatomic structure of the kidneys and are used to measure total kidney volume (TKV) in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients. TKV has become the gold-standard image biomarker for ADPKD progression at early stages of the disease and is used in clinical trials to characterize treatment efficacy. Automated methods to segment the kidneys and measure TKV are desirable because of the long time requirement for manual approaches such as stereology or planimetry tracings. However, ADPKD kidney segmentation is complicated by a number of factors, including irregular kidney shapes and variable tissue signal at the kidney borders.We describe an image processing approach that overcomes these problems by using a baseline segmentation initialization to provide automatic segmentation of follow-up scans obtained years apart. We validated our approach using 20 patients with complete baseline and follow-up T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. Both manual tracing and stereology were used to calculate TKV, with two observers performing manual tracings and one observer performing repeat tracings. Linear correlation and Bland-Altman analysis were performed to compare the different approaches.Our automated approach measured TKV at a level of accuracy (mean difference ± standard error = 0.99 ± 0.79\%) on par with both intraobserver (0.77 ± 0.46\%) and interobserver variability (1.34 ± 0.70\%) of manual tracings. All approaches had excellent agreement and compared favorably with ground-truth manual tracing with interobserver, stereological and automated approaches having 95\% confidence intervals ∼ ± 100 mL.Our method enables fast, cost-effective and reproducible quantification of ADPKD progression that will facilitate and lower the costs of clinical trials in ADPKD and other disorders requiring accurate, longitudinal kidney quantification. In addition, it will hasten the routine use of TKV as a prognostic biomarker in ADPKD.},

Such quantitative analysis of DCE-MRI data provides physiological parameters that are able to provide information of tumor pathophysiology and therapeutic outcome. Several assumptive PK models have been proposed to characterize microcirculation in the tumoral tissue. In this paper, we present a comparative study between the well-known extended Tofts model (ETM) and the more recent gamma capillary transit time (GCTT) model, with the latter showing initial promising results in the literature. To enhance the GCTT imaging biomarkers, we introduce a novel method for segmenting the tumor area into subregions according to their vascular heterogeneity characteristics. A cohort of 11 patients diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme with known therapeutic outcome was used to assess the predictive value of both models in terms of correctly classifying responders and nonresponders based on only one DCE-MRI examination. The results indicate that GCTT model's PK parameters perform better than those of ETM, while the segmentation of the tumor regions of interest based on vascular heterogeneity further enhances the discriminatory power of the GCTT model.},

Cystatin C-based equations have also been developed to enhance accuracy for individuals with whom creatinine-based estimates for kidney function are acknowledged to be less accurate.The characteristics of the patients to whom the diagnostic test is applied can influence the sensitivity of the test. Thus, there is nowadays controversy over the best method to assess kidney function in general population.In the overwhelming majority of patients currently treated in primary care, the CKD-EPI creatinine equation is suitable for estimating renal function. The CKD-EPIcr-cys equation would provide further reliability in individuals with a CKD-EPI creatinine eGFR of 45-59 ml/min/1.73 m(2) , but the cost of serum cystatin C analysis limits its use in everyday general practice.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the main challenges in quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI is estimation of the arterial input function (AIF). Usually, the signal from a single artery (ignoring contrast dispersion, partial volume effects and flow artifacts) or a population average of such signals (also ignoring variability between patients) is used.Multi-channel blind deconvolution is an alternative approach avoiding most of these problems. The AIF is estimated directly from the measured tracer concentration curves in several tissues. This contribution extends the published methods of multi-channel blind deconvolution by applying a more realistic model of the impulse residue function, the distributed capillary adiabatic tissue homogeneity model (DCATH). In addition, an alternative AIF model is used and several AIF-scaling methods are tested.The proposed method is evaluated on synthetic data with respect to the number of tissue regions and to the signal-to-noise ratio. Evaluation on clinical data (renal cell carcinoma patients before and after the beginning of the treatment) gave consistent results. An initial evaluation on clinical data indicates more reliable and less noise sensitive perfusion parameter estimates.Blind multi-channel deconvolution using the DCATH model might be a method of choice for AIF estimation in a clinical setup.},

  Abstract                 = {To evaluate for the first time in an animal model the possibility of absolute regional quantification of renal medullary and cortical perfusion by dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) using a blood pool contrast agent.A total of 18 adult female pigs (age, 16-22 weeks; body weight, 45-65 kg; no dietary restrictions) were investigated by DCE-MRI. Absolute renal blood flow (RBF) measured by an ultrasound transit time flow probe around the renal vein was used as the standard of reference. An inflatable stainless cuff placed around the renal artery near its origin from the abdominal aorta was used to reduce RBF to 60\%, 40\%, and 20\% of the baseline flow. The last measurement was performed with the cuff fully reopened. Absolute RBF values during these 4 perfusion states were compared with the results of DCE-MRI performed on a 1.5-T scanner with an 8-channel phased-array surface coil. All scans were acquired in breath-hold technique in the coronal plane using a field of view of 460 mm.Each dynamic scan commenced with a set of five 3D T1-weighted gradient echo sequences with different flip angles (alpha = 2 degrees, 5 degrees, 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 30 degrees): TE, 0.88 milliseconds; TR, 2.65 milliseconds; slice thickness, 8.8 mm for 4 slices; acquisition matrix, 128 x 128; and acquisitions, 4. These data served to calculate 3D intrinsic longitudinal relaxation rate maps (R10) and magnetization (M0). Immediately after these images, the dynamic 3D T1-weighted gradient echo images were acquired with the same parameters and a constant alpha = 30 degrees, half Fourier, 1 acquisition, 64 frames, a time interval of 1.65 seconds between each frame, and a total duration of 105.6. Three milliliters of an albumin-binding blood pool contrast agent (0.25 mmol/mL gadofosveset trisodium, Vasovist, Bayer Schering Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany) was injected at a rate of 3 mL/s. Perfusion was calculated using the arterial input function from the aorta, which was extracted from the dynamic relaxation rate change maps and perfusion images were calculated on a voxel-by-voxel basis using a singular value decomposition.In 11 pigs, 4 different perfusion states were investigated sequentially. The reduced kidney perfusion measured by ultrasound highly correlated with total renal blood flow determined by DCE-MRI, P < 0.001. The correlation coefficient between both measurements was 0.843. Regional cortical and medullary renal flow was also highly correlated (r = 0.77/0.78, P < 0.001) with the degree of flow reduction. Perfusion values smaller than 50 mL/min/100 cm were overestimated by MRI, high perfusion values slightly underestimated.DCE-MRI using a blood pool contrast agent allows absolute quantification of total kidney perfusion as well as separate determination of cortical and medullary flow. The results show that our technique has sufficient accuracy and reproducibility to be transferred to the clinical setting.},

  Abstract                 = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) investigations of breast cancer incorporate computationally intense techniques to develop parametric maps of pathophysiological tissue characteristics. Common approaches employ, for example, quantitative measurements of T (1), the apparent diffusion coefficient, and kinetic modeling based on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI). In this paper, an integrated medical image post-processing and archive system (MIPAS) is presented. MIPAS demonstrates how image post-processing and user interface programs, written in the interactive data language (IDL) programming language with data storage provided by a Microsoft Access database, and the file system can reduce turnaround time for creating MRI parametric maps and provide additional organization for clinical trials. The results of developing the MIPAS are discussed including potential limitations of the use of IDL for the application framework and how the MIPAS design supports extension to other programming languages and imaging modalities. We also show that network storage of images and metadata has a significant (p < 0.05) increase in data retrieval time compared to collocated storage. The system shows promise for becoming both a robust research picture archival and communications system working with the standard hospital PACS and an image post-processing environment that extends to other medical image modalities.},

In this study, single-input flow-limited (FL), Tofts-Kety (TK), extended TK (ETK), Hayton-Brady (HB), two compartment exchange (2CX), and adiabatic approximation to the tissue homogeneity (AATH) models were applied to the analysis of liver 4-phase DCE-CT data with fully continuous-time parameter formulation, including the bolus arrival time. The bolus arrival time for the 2CX and AATH models was described by modifying the vascular transport operator theory.

  Abstract                 = {Estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is essential for clinical practice, research, and public health. Appropriate interpretation of estimated GFR (eGFR) requires understanding the principles of physiology, laboratory medicine, epidemiology, and biostatistics used in the development and validation of GFR estimating equations. Equations developed in diverse populations are less biased at higher GFRs than equations developed in chronic kidney disease (CKD) populations and are more appropriate for general use. Equations that include multiple endogenous filtration markers are more precise than equations including a single filtration marker. The CKD-EPI (CKD Epidemiology Collaboration) equations are the most accurate GFR estimating equations that have been evaluated in large diverse populations and are applicable for general clinical use. The 2009 CKD-EPI creatinine equation is more accurate in estimating GFR and prognosis than the 2006 MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) Study equation and provides lower estimates of prevalence of decreased eGFR. It is useful as a "first test" for decreased eGFR and should replace the MDRD Study equation for routine reporting of serum creatinine-based eGFR by clinical laboratories. The 2012 CKD-EPI cystatin C equation is as accurate as the 2009 CKD-EPI creatinine equation in estimating GFR, does not require specification of race, and may be more accurate in patients with decreased muscle mass. The 2012 CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C equation is more accurate than the 2009 CKD-EPI creatinine and 2012 CKD-EPI cystatin C equations and is useful as a confirmatory test for decreased eGFR as determined by serum creatinine-based eGFR. Further improvement in GFR estimating equations will require development in more broadly representative populations, including diverse racial and ethnic groups, use of multiple filtration markers, and evaluation using statistical techniques to compare eGFR to "true GFR."},

While much of the early work and a significant amount of present work is based on invasive methods or ex vivo analysis, and is therefore restricted to animal models, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) MR imaging has been shown to extend these findings to human beings. BOLD MR imaging is most useful in monitoring effects of physiologic or pharmacologic maneuvers. Several teams around the world have demonstrated reproducible data and have illustrated several useful applications. Studies supporting the use of renal BOLD MR imaging in characterizing disease with prognostic value have also been reported.

We performed the present studies on a 3.0 T scanner using a multiple gradient-echo (mGRE) sequence with a multicoil array to acquire 16 T2*-weighted images within a single breath-hold. Data were obtained before and after administration of furosemide (20 mg iv).The baseline renal R2* (mean +/- SE) at 3.0 T was 37.4+/-1.2 Hz in the medulla, and 21.8 +/- 1.2 Hz in the cortex. The BOLD response to furosemide (DeltaR2*) at 3.0 T was 11.8 +/- 1.1 Hz in the medulla, and 3.0 +/- 0.5 Hz in the cortex.Higher magnetic field strength is beneficial for renal BOLD MRI studies. The cortico-medullary contrast on the R2* map was significantly improved at 3.0 T, with no evidence of increased bulk susceptibility artifacts. Baseline R2* and DeltaR2* in the renal medulla at 3.0 T were both significantly higher compared to our previously reported data obtained at 1.5 T.},

  Abstract                 = {Renal diseases can lead to kidney failure that requires life-long dialysis or renal transplantation. Early detection and treatment can prevent progression towards end stage renal disease. MRI has evolved into a standard examination for the assessment of the renal morphology and function. We propose a wavelet-based clustering to group the voxel time courses and thereby, to segment the renal compartments. This approach comprises (1) a nonparametric, discrete wavelet transform of the voxel time course, (2) thresholding of the wavelet coefficients using Stein's Unbiased Risk estimator, and (3) k-means clustering of the wavelet coefficients to segment the kidneys. Our method was applied to 3D dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE-) MRI data sets of human kidney in four healthy volunteers and three patients. On average, the renal cortex in the healthy volunteers could be segmented at 88\%, the medulla at 91\%, and the pelvis at 98\% accuracy. In the patient data, with aberrant voxel time courses, the segmentation was also feasible with good results for the kidney compartments. In conclusion wavelet based clustering of DCE-MRI of kidney is feasible and a valuable tool towards automated perfusion and glomerular filtration rate quantification.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic-Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) has been used widely for clinical applications. Pharmacokinetic modeling of DCE-MRI data that extracts quantitative contrast reagent/tissue-specific model parameters is the most investigated method. One of the primary challenges in pharmacokinetic analysis of DCE-MRI data is accurate and reliable measurement of the arterial input function (AIF), which is the driving force behind all pharmacokinetics. Because of effects such as inflow and partial volume averaging, AIF measured from individual arteries sometimes require amplitude scaling for better representation of the blood contrast reagent (CR) concentration time-courses. Empirical approaches like blinded AIF estimation or reference tissue AIF derivation can be useful and practical, especially when there is no clearly visible blood vessel within the imaging field-of-view (FOV). Similarly, these approaches generally also require magnitude scaling of the derived AIF time-courses. Since the AIF varies among individuals even with the same CR injection protocol and the perfect scaling factor for reconstructing the ground truth AIF often remains unknown, variations in estimated pharmacokinetic parameters due to varying AIF scaling factors are of special interest. In this work, using simulated and real prostate cancer DCE-MRI data, we examined parameter variations associated with AIF scaling. Our results show that, for both the fast-exchange-limit (FXL) Tofts model and the water exchange sensitized fast-exchange-regime (FXR) model, the commonly fitted CR transfer constant (K(trans)) and the extravascular, extracellular volume fraction (ve) scale nearly proportionally with the AIF, whereas the FXR-specific unidirectional cellular water efflux rate constant, kio, and the CR intravasation rate constant, kep, are both AIF scaling insensitive. This indicates that, for DCE-MRI of prostate cancer and possibly other cancers, kio and kep may be more suitable imaging biomarkers for cross-platform, multicenter applications. Data from our limited study cohort show that kio correlates with Gleason scores, suggesting that it may be a useful biomarker for prostate cancer disease progression monitoring.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI using Tofts' model for estimating vascular permeability is widely accepted, yet inter-tissue differences in bolus arrival time (BAT) are generally ignored. In this work we propose a method, incorporating the BAT in the analysis, demonstrating its applicability and advantages in healthy subjects and patients. A method for DCE Up Sampled TEmporal Resolution (DUSTER) analysis is proposed which includes: baseline T1 map using DESPOT1 analyzed with flip angle (FA) correction; preprocessing; raw-signal-to-T1-to-concentration time curves (CTC) conversion; automatic arterial input function (AIF) extraction at temporal super-resolution; model fitting with model selection while incorporating BAT in the pharmacokinetic (PK) model, and fits contrast agent CTC while using exhaustive search in the BAT dimension in super-resolution. The method was applied to simulated data and to human data from 17 healthy subjects, six patients with glioblastoma, and two patients following stroke. BAT values were compared to time-to-peak (TTP) values extracted from dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging. Results show that the method improved the AIF estimation and allowed extraction of the BAT with a resolution of 0.8 s. In simulations, lower mean relative errors were detected for all PK parameters extracted using DUSTER compared to analysis without BAT correction (vp:5\% vs. 20\%, Ktrans: 9\% vs. 24\% and Kep: 8\% vs. 17\%, respectively), and BAT estimates demonstrated high correlations (r = 0.94, p < 1e− 10) with true values. In real data, high correlations between BAT values were detected when extracted from data acquired with high temporal resolution (2 s) and sub-sampled standard resolution data (6 s) (mean r = 0.85,p < 1e− 10). BAT and TTP values were significantly correlated in the different brain regions in healthy subjects (mean r = 0.72,p = < 1e− 3), as were voxel-wise comparisons in patients (mean r = 0.89, p < 1e− 10). In conclusion, incorporating BAT in DCE analysis improves estimation accuracy for the AIF and the PK parameters while providing an additional clinically important parameter.},

Signal intensity enhanced time curves were analyzed with a mathematical model and a widely published separable compartment model on cortex regions to assess robustness versus motion artifacts.BLADE-measurements with a strip-width of 32 lines constituted the smallest mean values for the sum of squared errors (6065 ± 4996) compared with the measurement with a strip-width of 64 lines (13849 ± 14079) or the standard TurboFLASH (11884 ± 8076). Calculations concerning goodness of the fit of the applied compartment model yielded an overall average of the Akaike Fit Error of 732 ± 141 for BLADE (646 ± 149 for a strip-width of 32 lines, 816 ± 53 for 64 lines) and 1626 ± 303 for the TurboFLASH (TFL) sequence.We demonstrated that renal dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging using BLADE k-space sampling with a strip-width of 32 is significantly less sensitive to motion than a widely published Turbo-Flash sequence with nearly similar parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this study was to assess the potential of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI to predict and evaluate functional outcomes after renal artery revascularization for renal artery stenosis (RAS). The single-kidney glomerular filtration rate (SK-GFR) was measured in 15 patients with atherosclerotic RAS with DCE-MRI and radioisotopes at baseline and 4 mo after revascularization. DCE-MRI also produced measurements of blood flow, blood volume, extraction fraction, tubular transit time, and functional volume. Stented kidneys (n = 22) were divided into three response groups on the basis of the changes in radioisotope SK-GFR: improved (n = 5), stable (n = 13), and deteriorated (n = 4). A good agreement was found between SK-GFR values from DCE-MRI and radioisotopes (correlation coefficient: 0.91). Before intervention, kidneys that improved had lower extraction fraction, higher blood volume, longer tubular transit time, and lower SK-GFR. After intervention, improved kidneys had increased functional volume, and deteriorated kidneys had reduced functional volume and extraction fraction. Revascularization improved blood flow and blood volume in all groups. This pilot study led to the hypothesis that well-vascularized kidneys with reduced extraction fractions are most likely to benefit from revascularization. More generally, DCE-MRI has the potential to replace radioisotope measurement of SK-GFR and may improve patient management by providing additional information on tissue perfusion.},

  Abstract                 = {To incorporate a newly developed shape-based motion estimation scheme into magnetic resonance urography (MRU) and verify its efficacy in facilitating quantitative functional analysis.The authors propose a motion compensation scheme in MRU that consists of three sequential modules: MRU image acquisition, motion compensation, and quantitative functional analysis. They designed two sets of complementary experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. In the first experiment, dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MR images were acquired from three sedated subjects, from which clinically valid estimates were derived and served as the "ground truth." Physiologically sound motion was then simulated to synthesize image sequences influenced by respiratory motion. Quantitative assessment and comparison were performed on functional estimates of Patlak number, glomerular filtration rate, and Patlak differential renal function without and with motion compensation against the ground truth. In the second experiment, the authors acquired a temporal series of noncontrast MR images under free breathing from a healthy adult subject. The performance of the proposed method on compensating real motion was evaluated by comparing the standard deviation of the obtained temporal intensity curves before and after motion compensation.On DCE-MR images with simulated motion, the generated relative enhancement curves exhibited large perturbations and the Patlak numbers of the left and right kidney were significantly underestimated up to 35\% and 34\%, respectively, compared with the ground truth. After motion compensation, the relative enhancement curves exhibited much less perturbations and Patlak estimation errors reduced within 3\% and 4\% for the left and right kidneys, respectively. On clinical free-breathing MR images, the temporal intensity curves exhibited significantly reduced variations after motion compensation, with standard deviation decreased from 30.3 and 38.2 to 8.3 and 11.7 within two manually selected regions of interest, respectively.The developed motion compensation method has demonstrated its ability to facilitate quantitative MRU functional analysis, with improved accuracy of pharmacokinetic modeling and quantitative parameter estimations. Future work will consider performing more intensive clinical verifications with sophisticated pharmacokinetic models and generalizing the proposed method to other quantitative DCE analysis, such as on liver or prostate function.},

  Abstract                 = {Abdominal organs segmentation of magnetic resonance (MR) images is an important but challenging task in medical image processing. Especially for abdominal tissues or organs, such as liver and kidney, MR imaging is a very difficult task due to the fact that MR images are affected by intensity inhomogeneity, weak boundary, noise and the presence of similar objects close to each other.In this study, a novel method for tissue or organ segmentation in abdomen MR imaging is proposed; this method combines kernel graph cuts (KGC) with shape priors. First, the region growing algorithm and morphology operations are used to obtain the initial contour. Second, shape priors are obtained by training the shape templates, which were collected from different human subjects with kernel principle component analysis (KPCA) after the registration between all the shape templates and the initial contour. Finally, a new model is constructed by integrating the shape priors into the kernel graph cuts energy function. The entire process aims to obtain an accurate image segmentation.The proposed segmentation method has been applied to abdominal organs MR images. The results showed that a satisfying segmentation without boundary leakage and segmentation incorrect can be obtained also in presence of similar tissues. Quantitative experiments were conducted for comparing the proposed segmentation with other three methods: DRLSE, initial erosion contour and KGC without shape priors. The comparison is based on two quantitative performance measurements: the probabilistic rand index (PRI) and the variation of information (VoI). The proposed method has the highest PRI value (0.9912, 0.9983 and 0.9980 for liver, right kidney and left kidney respectively) and the lowest VoI values (1.6193, 0.3205 and 0.3217 for liver, right kidney and left kidney respectively).The proposed method can overcome boundary leakage. Moreover it can segment liver and kidneys in abdominal MR images without segmentation errors due to the presence of similar tissues. The shape priors based on KPCA was integrated into fully automatic graph cuts algorithm (KGC) to make the segmentation algorithm become more robust and accurate. Furthermore, if a shelter is placed onto the target boundary, the proposed method can still obtain satisfying segmentation results.},

To change this treatment paradigm, biomarkers that reflect the molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical-pathologic diagnoses are needed. Recent progress to identify such biomarkers has been aided by advances in molecular profiling, large-scale data generation and multi-scalar data integration, including prospectively collected clinical data.

The stochastic models are presented with various combinations of a probabilistic transfer mechanism, a random rate coefficient, and a random initial condition, and the mean value functions and covariances are derived for these models with both time-independent and time-varying rate coefficients. The covariances have unique forms that are helpful in model identification and many of the means are non-exponential functions. Outstanding among the conclusions are 1) a proof that a deterministic model is not always equivalent in an average sense to its stochastic counterpart; 2) the existence of many rich, practical, and realistic alternatives to the exponential decay function; and 3) the notion that models are identifiable from their covariance structure.},

The Bland-Altman method was used to assess the agreement between rsGFR and eGFR, separately in subjects with low (<60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) and normal (≥60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) rsGFR. The span between -1.96 and +1.96 standard deviations of mean difference (bias) was calculated and used for this purpose.In 76 subjects, an unknown low renal function was found by Tc(99m)DTPA renal scintigraphy. In subjects with normal rsGFR the Bland-Altman analysis showed that the smallest span between rsGFR and eGFR was evident for ClCr values (26.0 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), whereas higher values were detected with the CG and MDRD formulas (41.0 and 40.4 ml/min/1.73 m(2), respectively). The same results were observed for low rsGFR, where a smaller span was found for ClCr (21.2 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), whereas CG and MDRD methods gave greater results (30.4 and 31.8 ml/min/1.73 m(2) respectively); no differences were found between genders. The degree of agreement for eGFR estimated with the CG and MDRD formulas was wider than that derived from ClCr, reflecting a greater between-methods variability and a considerable discrepancy of rsGFR values in the former than in the latter.In HTs with normal SCr values, Tc(99m)DTPA renal scintigraphy discovered un known renal organ damage in 38\% of cases. If this methodology is not available, ClCr measurement should be preferred to estimate GFR whereas CG and MDRD formulas are of limited efficacy.},

Despite the efforts of the clinical and research communities, little has been achieved in the past decades in terms of improving the treatment of aggressive tumors. Understanding the underlying mechanism of tumor growth and evaluating the effects of different therapies are valuable steps in predicting the survival time and improving the patients' quality of life. Several studies have been devoted to tumor growth modeling at different levels to improve the clinical outcome by predicting the results of specific treatments. Recent studies have proposed patient-specific models using clinical data usually obtained from clinical images and evaluating the effects of various therapies. The aim of this review is to highlight the imaging role in tumor growth modeling and provide a worthwhile reference for biomedical and mathematical researchers with respect to tumor modeling using the clinical data to develop personalized models of tumor growth and evaluating the effect of different therapies.},

We investigated the sensitivity of volume transfer constant ([Formula: see text]) and extravascular extracellular volume fraction ([Formula: see text]) to BAT and compared the results of four automatic BAT measurement methods in characterization of prostate and breast cancers. Variation in delay between AIF and TRF resulted in a monotonous change trend of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] values. The results of automatic BAT estimators for clinical data were all comparable except for one BAT estimation method. Our results indicate that inaccuracies in BAT measurement can lead to variability among DCE-MRI PK model parameters, diminish the quality of model fit, and produce fewer valid voxels in a region of interest. Although the selection of the BAT method did not affect the direction of change in the treatment assessment cohort, we suggest that BAT measurement methods must be used consistently in the course of longitudinal studies to control measurement variability.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this study was to investigate the maximum height, area under the curve (AUC) and full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the aortic input function (AIF) in renal dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. We evaluated the significance of choice of size for regions of interest (ROI) in the aorta, reproducibility and inter-observer agreement of AIF measurements in healthy volunteers for renal DCE-MRI studies.Fifteen healthy volunteers (nine males, six females), mean age 28.8 years (range 23-36 years), underwent two DCE-MRI kidney studies under similar conditions. Oblique-coronal DCE-MRI data volumes were acquired on a 1.5 T Siemens Avanto scanner with a 3D-FLASH pulse-sequence (TE/TR=0.53/1.63 ms, flip angle=17 degrees, acquisition matrix=128 x 104 voxels, strong fat saturation, PAT factor=2 (GRAPPA) and 400 mm x 325 mm FOV). Each dynamic dataset consisted of 18 slices of 7.5 mm thickness (no gap) and an in-plane resolution of 3.1 mm x 3.1 mm, acquired every 2.5 s for >5 min. During the MR scan a dose of 0.05 mmol (0.1 mL) kg(-1) body weight of dimeglumine gadopentetate (Magnevist) was injected intravenously (2 mL s(-1) injection rate), followed by a 15 mL saline flush at the same rate, using a MR-compatible automated injector (Spectris). For each DCE-MRI study two observers each drew two ROIs in the abdominal aorta. Both ROIs were 3 voxels in width and had the same inferior limit (just above the emergence of the renal arteries from the aorta) but had different heights (4 voxels for one ROI and 10 voxels for the other). The dimensions, position and time of drawing the ROIs in the dynamic study were standardised between observers prior to data analysis. Mean signal intensities measured in the ROIs were plotted over time, representing the AIF. For each study, AIF 1 was derived from ROI 1 and AIF 2 was derived from ROI 2.Paired t-tests for inter-observer comparison on the pooled 30 DCE-MRI studies, showed good correlations (correlation coefficients >0.85) with no significant differences (p-values >0.82) when comparing the peak value, AUC and FWHM of the AIFs. Thus the results were operator independent. The size of the aortic ROIs significantly affected all measured parameters of the AIF (p-values <0.039). However, correlation coefficients when comparing AIF 1 and AIF 2 were high for all evaluated AIF parameters (correlation coefficients >0.88), indicating a similar shape and temporal dynamic of the passage of the contrast agent through the aorta. When comparing the intra-individual DCE-MRI studies for each volunteer all AIF parameters had p-values >0.22 and correlation coefficients <0.82, with the exception of the FWHM, which had a correlation coefficient of 0.96 showing a significant variation in AIF parameters in the same volunteer on different days.},

Claims in the current literature that Gadolinium (Gd) DTPA dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI clearance provides a reliable estimate of glomerular filtration are an overoptimistic interpretation of the results obtained. Before calculating absolute GFR from Gd-enhanced MRI, numerous variables must be considered.We examine the methodology in the published studies on absolute quantification of MRI-GFR. The techniques evaluated included the dose and volume of Gd-DTPA used, the speed of injection, acquisition sequences, orientation of the subject, re-processing, conversion of signal to concentration and the model used for analysis of the data as well as the MRI platform.Claims in the current literature that using DCE MRI "Gd DTPA clearance provides a good estimate of glomerular filtration" are not supported by the data presented and a more accurate conclusion should be that "no MRI approach used provides a wholly satisfactory measure of renal GFR function."This study suggests that DCE MRI-GFR results are not yet able to be used as a routine clinical or research tool. The published literature does not show what change in DCE MRI-GFR is clinically significant, nor do the results in the literature allow a single DCE MRI-GFR measurement to be correlated directly with a multiple blood sampling technique.},

The motion of the kidneys during the scan is a dominant limitation of the measurement quality, and image registration is necessary for accurate quantification. We analyzed the feasibility of applying an algorithm, originally developed for multimodal registration, to kidney perfusion time series. The algorithm uses a variational calculation scheme to align the images. In four out of five data sets, kidney motion could be reduced to below the spatial resolution of the images of 1.6mm while preserving the enhancement pattern of kidney perfusion. Fitting a pharmacokinetic model to the data showed an average reduction of the Akaike fit error of 10\% for the registered data, suggesting more stable parameters. We conclude that this image registration algorithm is feasible for correcting kidney motion in renal DCE-MRI.},

The loss of phase coherence (T2(*)) maps were generated in which kidney regions of interest were selected to differentiate the medulla and cortex, and R2(*) was equated to 1/T2(*). Individual R2(*) values were, in turn, correlated to the eGFR (MDRD formula of 280 patients with available serum creatinine measurements), age, and gender each for 1.5 and 3.0 T field-strength scans of 342 patients. At both the field strengths, no significant differences in R2(*) of the cortex and medulla were found between patient gender, age, eGFR, or between different stages of chronic kidney disease determined using the KDOQI system. Thus, BOLD-MRI of a non-specific patient population failed to discriminate between the patients with various stages of chronic kidney disease.},

This pictorial essay provides a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art functional renal imaging techniques including renal magnetic resonance angiography, first pass renal perfusion, assessment of renal function, blood-oxygen level dependent imaging of the kidneys and diffusion-weighted imaging of the kidneys including diffusion-tensor imaging of the kidneys. Basic technical concepts for all sequences are laid out. As renal perfusion imaging becomes a clinical routine examination, particular attention is given to renal perfusion measurements and the potential postprocessing approaches. Advantages and drawbacks of the published methods are illustrated. Future applications of functional renal imaging are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {The image analysis and kinetic modeling methods used in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the kidney are reviewed. Image analysis includes various techniques of coregistration and segmentation. Few methods have been completely implemented. Nevertheless, the use of coregistration may become a standard to decrease the effect of motion on abdominal images and improve the quality of the renal signals. Kinetic models are classified into three categories: enhancement-based, external and internal representations. Enhancement-based representations are limited to a basic analysis of the tracer concentration curves in the kidneys. Their relationship to the underlying physiology is complex and undefined. However, they can be used to evaluate the split renal function. External representations assess the kidney input and output. An external representation based on the up-slope of the renal enhancement to calculate the renal perfusion is commonly used because of its simplicity. In contrast, external representation based on deconvolution or identification methods remain underexploited. For glomerular filtration, an internal representation based on a two-compartmental model is mostly used. Internal representations based on multi-compartmental models describe the renal function in a more realistic way. Because of their numerical complexity, these models remain rarely used.},

BOLD MRI was performed using a multiple fast-field echo (FFE) sequence to acquire 20 T2(*)-weighted images within a single breath-hold. The rate of spin dephasing (R2(*)) values of solid and benign cystic renal lesions were compared, and the results of four subgroups--simple cysts, renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), hemorrhagic cysts, and angiomyolipomas (AMLs)--were analyzed. The degree of overall imaging quality in BOLD MRI was also assessed.One hundred three renal lesions were detected in the 71 patients. The mean (± SD) R2(*) values of 45 solid lesions (30.6 ± 19.4 1/s) were significantly higher than those of 58 benign cystic lesions (4.5 ± 4.8 1/s; p < 0.001). The mean R2(*) values of simple cysts, RCCs, hemorrhagic cysts, and AMLs were 1.7 ± 1.7, 22.6 ± 12.6, 10.7 ± 3.7, and 48.0 ± 25.5 1/s, respectively (p < 0.001). The degree of overall imaging quality in all patients was satisfactory or better.Renal BOLD MRI at 3 T is a feasible technique and may be useful for differentiating various renal lesions.},

  Abstract                 = {Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) allows for differentiation of benign from malignant tumors, histological tumor types and their grade. The aim of the study was to evaluate the capabilities of DWI using 3 Tesla Magnetic resonance imaging (3T MRI) in the preoperative assessment of renal tumors.This retrospective study included 143 tumors in 139 patients (130 malignant tumors and 13 benign tumors) that were examined using DWI with b values of 50, 400 and 800 s/mm(2). In all tumors, the lowest value of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the solid tissue was measured and correlated with the histological finding.A significant difference between ADCs of malignant and benign tumors was found (p<0.001). Comparison of the most common malignant and benign tumors clear-cell renal carcinoma (CCRCC) grade I and oncocytoma resulted in a difference of borderline significance with a marked overlap (p=0.046). By assessing the histological types of malignant tumors, we detected a significant difference between CCRCC and all other histological types (p=0.048 for chromophobe (CH) RCC, p=0.002 for papillary (P) RCC and p=0.002 for urothelial carcinoma (UC)). Mutual differentiation of other types of carcinomas was not feasible (p=1.0 in all cases). The differences between low-grade (grade I+II) and high-grade (grade III+IV) CCRCC was significant (p<0.001). A significant difference was found even between CCRCC grade I and others (p=0.01 for grade II, p<0.001 for grade III+IV, respectively).DWI may contribute in distinguishing CCRCC from other histological types and to determinits grade. The method has certain potential for distinguishing benign from malignant tumors; however, differentiation of the most frequently represented types, CCRCC grade I and oncocytoma, remains difficult.},

Specifically, systems of nephrons, the operational units of the kidney, are modelled and the dynamics of such systems are explored. Nephron behaviour can fluctuate widely and, under certain conditions, become chaotic. However, the behaviour of the whole kidney remains remarkably stable and blood solute levels are maintained under a wide range of conditions even when many nephrons are damaged or lost. A network model is used to investigate the stability of systems of nephrons and interactions between nephrons. More sophisticated dynamics are explored including the observed oscillations in single nephron filtration rates and the development of stable ionic and osmotic gradients in the inner medulla which contribute to the countercurrent exchange mechanism. We have used the model to explore the effects of changes in input parameters including hydrostatic and osmotic pressures and concentrations of ions, such as sodium and chloride. The intrinsic nephron control, tubuloglomerular feedback, is included and the effects of coupling between nephrons are explored in two-, eight- and 72-nephron models.},

A QIBA profile includes factors such as technical (product-specific) standards, user activities, and relationship to a clinically meaningful metric, such as with nodule measurement in the course of CT screening for lung cancer. In this report, the authors describe how the QIBA approach is being applied to the measurement of small pulmonary nodules such as those found during low-dose CT-based lung cancer screening. All sources of variance with imaging measurement were defined for this process. Through a process of experimentation, literature review, and assembly of expert opinion, the strongest evidence was used to define how to best implement each step in the imaging acquisition and evaluation process. This systematic approach to implementing a quantitative imaging biomarker with standardized specifications for image acquisition and postprocessing for a specific quantitative measurement of a pulmonary nodule results in consistent performance characteristics of the measurement (eg, bias and variance). Implementation of the QIBA small nodule profile may allow more efficient and effective clinical management of the diagnostic workup of individuals found to have suspicious pulmonary nodules in the course of lung cancer screening evaluation.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the major functions of the kidney is to maintain constant renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate in response to increases in renal perfusion pressure. This phenomenon is referred to autoregulation and involves two independent mechanisms: tubular glomerular feedback and myogenic response. The latter, the renal myogenic response, involves constriction of the preglomerular vasculature to increases in transmural pressure. Over the last three decades, there has been substantial evidence that demonstrates that the myogenic response plays an important role in protecting the kidney from hypertension-induced renal injury. Furthermore, impairment of the renal myogenic response allows the transmission of systemic pressures to the glomerular capillaries leading to the development of glomerular injury and progressive proteinuria during hypertension. This review article discusses the role of the myogenic response in the pathogenesis of renal disease in various genetic and experimental rodent models that develop hypertension-induced renal injury.},

Comparisons were performed on simulated data. The best algorithm was applied to seven patients with brain tumors or following stroke. The extracted perfusion parameters were compared to those of dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI (DSC-MRI).ACoPeD (AIF-corrected-perfusion-DCE-MRI), an analysis using a 2(nd) derivative regularized-spline and incorporating BAT, achieved the most accurate estimation in simulated data, mean-relative-error: Fp , F, vp , ve : 24.8\%, 41.7\%, 26.4\%, 27.2\% vs. 76.5\%, 190.8\%, 78.8\%, 82.39\% of the direct four parameters estimation (one-sided two-sample t-test, P < 0.001). Correction for BAT increased the estimation accuracy of the PK parameters by more than 30\% and provided a supertemporal resolution estimation of the BAT (higher than the acquired resolution, mean-absolute-error 0.2 sec). High temporal resolution (∼2 sec) is required to avoid biased estimation of PK parameters, and long scan duration (∼20 min) is important for reliable permeability but not for perfusion estimations, mean-error-reduction: E: ∼12\%, ve : ∼6\%. Using ACoPeD, PK values from normal-appearing white matter, gray matter, and lesion were extracted from patients. Preliminary results showed significant voxelwise correlations to DSC-MRI, between flow values in a patient following stroke (r = 0.49, P < 0.001), and blood volume in a patient with a brain tumor (r = 0.62, P < 0.001).This study proposes an optimized analysis method, ACoPeD, for tissue perfusion and permeability estimation using DCE-MRI, to be used in clinical settings.

  Abstract                 = {Renal tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia are key elements in the pathophysiology of acute kidney injury and its progression to chronic kidney disease. Yet, in vivo assessment of renal haemodynamics and tissue oxygenation remains a challenge. Many of the established approaches are invasive, hence not applicable in humans. Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers an alternative. BOLD-MRI is non-invasive and indicative of renal tissue oxygenation. Nonetheless, recent (pre-) clinical studies revived the question as to how bold renal BOLD-MRI really is. This review aimed to deliver some answers. It is designed to inspire the renal physiology, nephrology and imaging communities to foster explorations into the assessment of renal oxygenation and haemodynamics by exploiting the powers of MRI. For this purpose, the specifics of renal oxygenation and perfusion are outlined. The fundamentals of BOLD-MRI are summarized. The link between tissue oxygenation and the oxygenation-sensitive MR biomarker T2∗ is outlined. The merits and limitations of renal BOLD-MRI in animal and human studies are surveyed together with their clinical implications. Explorations into detailing the relation between renal T2∗ and renal tissue partial pressure of oxygen (pO2 ) are discussed with a focus on factors confounding the T2∗ vs. tissue pO2 relation. Multi-modality in vivo approaches suitable for detailing the role of the confounding factors that govern T2∗ are considered. A schematic approach describing the link between renal perfusion, oxygenation, tissue compartments and renal T2∗ is proposed. Future directions of MRI assessment of renal oxygenation and perfusion are explored.},

Arterial spin labeling and BOLD MRI of the kidneys were performed on donors before transplant surgery (baseline) and on both donors and recipients at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after transplant. After 3 months, 7 of the 15 recipients were prescribed 25 to 50 mg/d losartan for the remainder of the study. A linear mixed-effects model was used to evaluate perfusion, R2*, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and fractional excretion of sodium for changes across time or associated with losartan treatment.In donors, cortical perfusion in the remaining kidney decreased by 50 ± 19 mL/min per 100 g (11.8\%) between baseline and 2 years (P < 0.05), while cortical R2* declined modestly by 0.7 ± 0.3 s-1 (5.6\%; P < 0.05). In transplanted kidneys, cortical perfusion decreased markedly by 141 ± 21 mL/min per 100 g (34.2\%) between baseline and 2 years (P < 0.001), while medullary R2* declined by 1.5 ± 0.8 s-1 (8.3\%; P = 0.06). Single-kidney estimated glomerular filtration rate increased between baseline and 2 years by 17.7 ± 2.7 mL/min per 1.73 m (40.3\%; P < 0.0001) in donors and to 14.6 ± 4.3 mL/min per 1.73 m (33.3\%; P < 0.01) in recipients. Cortical perfusion at 1 and 2 years in recipients receiving 25 to 50 mg/d losartan was 62 ± 24 mL/min per 100 g higher than recipients not receiving the drug (P < 0.05). No significant effects of losartan were observed for any other markers of renal function.The results suggest an important role for noninvasive functional monitoring with ASL and BOLD MRI in kidney transplant recipients and donors, and they indicate a potentially beneficial effect of losartan in recipients.},

In four pigs a bolus of gadopentetate-dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA; no protein binding) was injected, followed by gadobenate-dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA; 10\% protein binding). The order was reversed in the other four pigs. A two-compartment filtration model was generalized to allow for protein binding and fitted to whole-cortex region of interest (ROI) curves. Single-kidney plasma flow and volume, tubular flow (or GFR), and tubular transit time of both agents were compared.The data show a strong systematic underestimation (P < 0.001) in GFR by Gd-BOPTA (33 ± 7.2\%), and no significant differences (P > 0.05) in plasma flow (2.2 ± 18\%), plasma volume (-1.7 ± 7.8\%) and tubular transit time (3.1 ± 7.2\%). The order of injection had no significant effect.Theory and experiments agree that perfusion parameters of both agents are comparable, whereas GFR is underestimated with Gd-BOPTA due to the dependence of relaxivity on protein content. Hence, GFR cannot be measured with protein-bound contrast agents, but the proposed dual-agent protocol may produce new functional indices measuring protein filtration.},

The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was calculated with a monoexponential decay. The spin-dephasing rate R2* was derived from parametric R2* maps. DCE-MRI was analyzed using a two-compartment exchange model allowing separation of perfusion (plasma flow [FP] and plasma volume [VP]), permeability (permeability surface area product [PS]), and extravascular extracellular volume (VE). Statistical analysis was performed with Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.Clear-cell RCC showed higher ADC and lower R2* compared to papillary subtypes, but differences were not significant. FP of clear-cell subtypes was significantly higher than in papillary RCC. Perfusion parameters showed moderate but significant inverse correlation with R2*. VE showed moderate inverse correlation with ADC. Fp and Vp showed best sensitivity for histological differentiation.Multiparametric MRI comprising DWI, BOLD, and DCE MRI is feasible for assessment of primary RCC. BOLD moderately correlates to DCE MRI-derived perfusion. ADC shows moderate correlation to the extracellular volume, but does not correlate to tumor oxygenation or perfusion. In this preliminary study DCE-MRI appeared superior to BOLD and DWI for histological differentiation.},

  Abstract                 = {A major initiative of the Quantitative Imaging Biomarker Alliance is to develop standards-based documents called "Profiles," which describe one or more technical performance claims for a given imaging modality. The term "actor" denotes any entity (device, software, or person) whose performance must meet certain specifications for the claim to be met. The objective of this paper is to present the statistical issues in testing actors' conformance with the specifications. In particular, we present the general rationale and interpretation of the claims, the minimum requirements for testing whether an actor achieves the performance requirements, the study designs used for testing conformity, and the statistical analysis plan. We use three examples to illustrate the process: apparent diffusion coefficient in solid tumors measured by MRI, change in Perc 15 as a biomarker for the progression of emphysema, and percent change in solid tumor volume by computed tomography as a biomarker for lung cancer progression.},

While there is a rich history of the development of quantitative imaging biomarker (QIB) techniques, little attention has been paid to the validation and comparison of the computer algorithms that implement the QIB measurements. In this paper we provide a framework for QIB algorithm comparisons. We first review and compare various study designs, including designs with the true value (e.g. phantoms, digital reference images, and zero-change studies), designs with a reference standard (e.g. studies testing equivalence with a reference standard), and designs without a reference standard (e.g. agreement studies and studies of algorithm precision). The statistical methods for comparing QIB algorithms are then presented for various study types using both aggregate and disaggregate approaches. We propose a series of steps for establishing the performance of a QIB algorithm, identify limitations in the current statistical literature, and suggest future directions for research.},

The tool incorporates a friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to interactively select and analyze a region of interest (ROI) within the image set, taking into account the tissue concentration of the contrast agent (CA) and its effect on pixel intensity.Pixel-wise model-based quantitative parameters are estimated by fitting DCE-MRI data to several pharmacokinetic models using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA). DCE@urLAB also includes the semi-quantitative parametric and heuristic analysis approaches commonly used in practice. This software application has been programmed in the Interactive Data Language (IDL) and tested both with publicly available simulated data and preclinical studies from tumor-bearing mouse brains.A user-friendly solution for applying pharmacokinetic and non-quantitative analysis DCE-MRI in preclinical studies has been implemented and tested. The proposed tool has been specially designed for easy selection of multi-pixel ROIs.

  Abstract                 = {Renal medullary function is characterized by corticopapillary concentration gradients of various molecules. One example is the generally decreasing axial gradient in oxygen tension (Po2). Another example, found in animals in the antidiuretic state, is a generally increasing axial solute gradient, consisting mostly of NaCl and urea. This osmolality gradient, which plays a principal role in the urine concentrating mechanism, is generally considered to involve countercurrent multiplication and countercurrent exchange, although the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Radial oxygen and solute gradients in the transverse dimension of the medullary parenchyma have been hypothesized to occur, although strong experimental evidence in support of these gradients remains lacking. This review considers anatomic features of the renal medulla that may impact the formation and maintenance of oxygen and solute gradients. A better understanding of medullary architecture is essential for more clearly defining the compartment-to-compartment flows taken by fluid and molecules that are important in producing axial and radial gradients. Preferential interactions between nephron and vascular segments provide clues as to how tubular and interstitial oxygen flows contribute to safeguarding active transport pathways in renal function in health and disease.},

Multiple fast-field echo sequences were performed at gradient echoes of 8, 16, and 20 to obtain T2(*)-weighted images. The reproducibility of BOLD MRI was evaluated in patients with normal allografts.Cortical and medullary R2(*) values were not significantly different between healthy volunteers and patients with normal allografts, but medullary R2(*) values were significantly greater than cortical R2(*) values in both groups for all three protocols (p < 0.01). Medullary R2(*) values were significantly lower in cases of acute allograft rejection than in normal allografts for all three protocols (p < 0.001). The mean difference in cortical or medullary R2(*) values was 3.8\% or less in all protocols.BOLD MRI performed using different gradient echoes at 3 T is feasible and reproducible in patients with renal allografts and can show significant changes in medullary oxygenation in patients with acute rejection.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability to noninvasively discriminate the most common types of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) based on their magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearances or their magnetic resonance phenotypes is achievable. Intracellular lipids, a histologic characteristic of the clear cell RCC, can be identified on chemical shift MRI. Intratumoral hemosiderin deposition, as observed histologically with papillary RCC, correlates to the low signal intensity on T2-weighted images. In addition to morphologic imaging features, the different subtypes of RCC have distinct patterns of enhancement on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. Clear cell tumors demonstrate much greater enhancement than papillary and chromophobe RCCs during the corticomedullary and nephrographic phases. The MRI technique arterial spin labeling (ASL) uses magnetic fields to label the water protons in arterial blood and measures blood flow into tissue; quantitative images of blood flow can be generated without exogenous contrast media. Multiple measurements of tumor perfusion may be repeated before and after a physiologic or drug challenge (ie, antiangiogenic therapy). In RCC xenografts and in patients with metastatic RCC, ASL MRI assessments can be used to monitor blood flow changes in response to antiangiogenic therapies. High blood flow on ASL MRI in RCC xenografts correlates with viable tumor at histopathologic analysis, whereas zones of absent or diminished signal correspond to necrosis. ASL MRI has the potential to serve as a biomarker for patients with metastatic RCC by offering a noninvasive measure of tumor blood flow changes accompanying antiangiogenic therapy.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this study is to investigate whether early changes in tumor volume and perfusion measurements derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) may predict response to antiangiogenic therapy in recurrent high-grade gliomas.Twenty-seven patients who received bevacizumab every 3 weeks were enrolled in the study. For each patient, three MRI scans were performed: at baseline, after the first dose, and after the fourth dose of bevacizumab. The entire tumor volume (V(tot)), as well as contrast-enhanced and noncontrast-enhanced tumor subvolumes (V(CE-T1) and V(NON-CE-T1), respectively) were outlined using post-contrast T1-weighted images as a guide for the tumor location. Histogram analysis of normalized IAUGC (nIAUGC) and transfer constant K(trans) maps were performed. Each patient was classified as a responder patient if he/she had a partial response or a stable disease or as a nonresponder patient if he/she had progressive disease.Responding patients showed a larger reduction in V(NON-CE-T1) after a single dose, compared to nonresponding patients. Tumor subvolumes with increased values of nIAUGC and K(trans), after a single dose, significantly differed between responders and nonresponders. The radiological response was found to be significantly associated to the clinical outcome. After a single dose, V(tot) was predictive of overall survival (OS), while V(CE-T1) showed a tendency of correlation with OS.Tumor subvolumes with increased nIAUGC and K(trans) showed the potential for improving the diagnostic accuracy of DCE. Early assessments of the entire tumor volume, including necrotic areas, may provide complementary information of tumor behavior in response to anti-VEGF therapies and is worth further investigation.},

In the CO-technique, R2* values were based on a semi-automatic procedure that divided each kidney in six equal layers, whereas in the ROI-technique, all circles (ROIs) were placed manually in the cortex and medulla. The mean R2*values as assessed by two independent investigators were compared.With the CO-technique, inter-observer variability was 0.7\%-1.9\% across all layers in non-CKD, versus 1.6\%-3.8\% in CKD. With the ROI-technique, median variability for cortical and medullary R2* values was 3.6 and 6.8\% in non-CKD, versus 4.7 and 12.5\% in CKD; similar results were observed after furosemide.The CO-technique offers a new, investigator-independent, highly reproducible alternative to the ROI-based technique to estimate renal tissue oxygenation in CKD.},

  Abstract                 = {Acute kidney injury of various origins shares a common link in the pathophysiological chain of events: imbalance between renal medullary oxygen delivery and oxygen demand. For in vivo assessment of kidney haemodynamics and oxygenation in animals, quantitative but invasive physiological methods are established. A very limited number of studies attempted to link these invasive methods with parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the kidney. Moreover, the validity of parametric MRI (pMRI) as a surrogate marker for renal tissue perfusion and renal oxygenation has not been systematically examined yet. For this reason, we set out to combine invasive techniques and non-invasive MRI in an integrated hybrid setup (MR-PHYSIOL) with the ultimate goal to calibrate, monitor and interpret parametric MR and physiological parameters by means of standardized interventions. Here we present a first report on the current status of this multi-modality approach. For this purpose, we first highlight key characteristics of renal perfusion and oxygenation. Second, concepts for in vivo characterization of renal perfusion and oxygenation are surveyed together with the capabilities of MRI for probing blood oxygenation-dependent tissue stages. Practical concerns evoked by the use of strong magnetic fields in MRI and interferences between MRI and invasive physiological probes are discussed. Technical solutions that balance the needs of in vivo physiological measurements together with the constraints dictated by small bore MR scanners are presented. An early implementation of the integrated MR-PHYSIOL approach is demonstrated including brief interventions of hypoxia and hyperoxia.},

A free-breathing 3D-FSPGR sequence was used to acquire coronal views encompassing both kidneys following the infusion of Gd-BOPTA. A two-step registration algorithm was developed, including a preliminary registration minimising the quadratic difference and a fine registration maximising the mutual information (MI) between consecutive image frames. The starting point for the MI-based registration procedure was provided by an adaptive predictor that was able to predict kidney motion using a respiratory movement model. The algorithm was validated against manual registration performed by an expert user.The mean distance between the automatically and manually defined contours was 2.95 ± 0.81 mm, which was not significantly different from the interobserver variability of the manual registration procedure (2.86 ± 0.80 mm, P = 0.80). The perfusion indices evaluated on the manually and automatically extracted perfusion curves were not significantly different.The developed method is able to automatically compensate for kidney motion in perfusion studies, which prevents the need for time-consuming manual image registration.},

Adequate renal tissue oxygenation is crucial for the maintenance of renal function. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of cocoa-rich dark chocolate (DC) on renal tissue oxygenation in humans, as compared to flavonoid-poor white chocolate (WC).Ten healthy volunteers with preserved kidney function (mean age ± SD 35 ± 12 years, 70\% women, BMI 21 ± 3 kg/m2) underwent blood oxygenation level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-MRI) before and 2 hours after the ingestion of 1 g/kg of DC (70\% cocoa). Renal tissue oxygenation was determined by the measurement of R2* maps on 4 coronal slices covering both kidneys. The mean R2* (= 1/T2*) values in the medulla and cortex were calculated, a low R2* indicating high tissue oxygenation. Eight participants also underwent BOLD-MRI at least 1 week later, before and 2 hours after the intake of 1 g/kg WC.The mean medullary R2* was lower after DC intake compared to baseline (28.2 ± 1.3 s-1 vs. 29.6 ± 1.3 s-1, p = 0.04), whereas cortical and medullary R2* values did not change after WC intake. The change in medullary R2* correlated with the level of circulating (epi)catechines, metabolites of flavonoids (r = 0.74, p = 0.037), and was independent of plasma renin activity.This study suggests for the first time an increase of renal medullary oxygenation after intake of dark chocolate. Whether this is linked to flavonoid-induced changes in renal perfusion or oxygen consumption, and whether cocoa has potentially renoprotective properties, merits further study.},

  Abstract                 = {Experimentally renal tissue hypoxia appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and arterial hypertension (AHT). In this study we measured renal tissue oxygenation and its determinants in humans using blood oxygenation level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-MRI) under standardized hydration conditions. Four coronal slices were selected, and a multi gradient echo sequence was used to acquire T2* weighted images. The mean cortical and medullary R2* values ( = 1/T2*) were calculated before and after administration of IV furosemide, a low R2* indicating a high tissue oxygenation. We studied 195 subjects (95 CKD, 58 treated AHT, and 42 healthy controls). Mean cortical R2 and medullary R2* were not significantly different between the groups at baseline. In stimulated conditions (furosemide injection), the decrease in R2* was significantly blunted in patients with CKD and AHT. In multivariate linear regression analyses, neither cortical nor medullary R2* were associated with eGFR or blood pressure, but cortical R2* correlated positively with male gender, blood glucose and uric acid levels. In conclusion, our data show that kidney oxygenation is tightly regulated in CKD and hypertensive patients at rest. However, the metabolic response to acute changes in sodium transport is altered in CKD and in AHT, despite preserved renal function in the latter group. This suggests the presence of early renal metabolic alterations in hypertension. The correlations between cortical R2* values, male gender, glycemia and uric acid levels suggest that these factors interfere with the regulation of renal tissue oxygenation.},

The classic method of measuring inulin clearance in humans includes constant intravenous infusion of the compound and timed collections of urine. In order to avoid the need for timed urine collections, a number of alternative procedures have been devised. All these methods only use determinations of inulin in plasma or serum. From these, the total body inulin clearance is obtained using pharmacokinetic calculations. In order to measure total body clearance, usually called plasma clearance, inulin is either given as a constant intravenous infusion or as a bolus infusion. Both procedures overestimate GFR because of incomplete distribution of inulin during the study periods. The error may be minimized by using model-independent pharmacokinetic calculations. Unlike inulin, creatinine is not a perfect filtration marker. This is because the substance is not only eliminated by glomerular filtration but also by tubular secretion. The extent of tubular creatinine secretion is not constant in various individuals. Serum creatinine concentration is a commonly used measure of renal function in clinical practice. This parameter is determined both by the renal elimination and by the production of the compound. Differences in creatinine production among subjects and over time in a single individual may occur because of changes in muscle mass. Radioisotopic filtration markers can easily and accurately be measured in plasma and serum. Using this method, the plasma concentration-time curve of these compounds can easily be studied after intravenous bolus injection. From the plasma concentration-time curves obtained, the total body clearance (plasma clearance) of the substances can be calculated using pharmacokinetic models. Most frequently, 125l-iothalamate, 99mTc-diethylenethiaminepenta-acetic acid and 51Cr-ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid are used for the estimation of GFR in humans. The total body clearance of all these filtration markers overestimates GFR. The error induced by this phenomenon is particularly relevant at low levels of GFR. In recent years, iohexol has been used as a filtration marker. The substance can be measured in plasma, serum and urine using high-performance liquid chromatography. So far, good agreement has been shown for GFR determined by the classic inulin clearance and by the iohexol plasma clearance. Screening for proteinuria is commonly performed using reagent test strips. Quantitative measurements of marker proteins can be used to estimate the extent and the site of damage in the nephron. These measurements may be used to estimate the progression of renal disease and the response to therapeutic interventions. Of particular interest is the degree of albuminuria which indicates nephropathy in diabetic patients and end-organ damage in patients with hypertension.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has proven to be quite sensitive for the characterization of masses and early response to therapy. However, it is fraught with a number of procedural challenges as well as a lack of standardization. In this article, we describe the use of a simple dialyzer-based flow system to evaluate reproducibility of dynamic contrast enhanced MRI under active flow conditions.The MR signal during a bolus injection of Gd-DTPA was analyzed to test the precision and variability of contrast agent kinetics during a typical dynamic contrast enhanced MRI sequence. A simple model allows an estimation of the washout rate constant of Gd-DTPA through the polysulfone tubules of the dialyzer.The simple flow phantom described here provided reproducible measurements of the washout rate constants. The washout rate increased from 0.20 ± 0.005 min(-1) to 0.25 ± 0.008 min(-1) over 32 weeks. Measurements were also made at week 24 using dynamic computed tomography and found to be 0.27 ± 0.006 min(-1) . Overall, the computed tomography derived rate constants results were found be ∼12\% higher than the corresponding MRI values.In this study, we show that a simple dialyzer-based flow phantom can be used for testing dynamic contrast enhanced MRI pulse sequences and also allows for short-term reproducibility testing of rate constants.},

Navigator-gated and breath-hold acquisitions followed by non-rigid image registration were used to control respiratory motion. The repeatability of the 4 MRI modalities was evaluated with the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and within-subject coefficient of variation (wsCV). Unpaired t-test and stepwise logistic regression were carried out to evaluate qMRI parameters between the LN and control groups.The reproducibility of the 4 qMRI modalities ranged from moderate to good (ICC=0.4-0.91, wsCV≤12\%) with a few exceptions. T1rho MRI and ASL renal blood flow (RBF) demonstrated significant differences between the LN and control groups. Stepwise logistic regression yielded only one significant parameter (medullar T1rho) in differentiating LN from control groups with 95\% accuracy.A reasonable degree of test-retest repeatability and accuracy of a multi-parametric renal qMRI protocol has been demonstrated in healthy volunteers and LN subjects. T1rho and ASL RBF are promising imaging biomarkers of LN.},

  Abstract                 = {Technological developments and greater rigor in the quantitative measurement of biological features in medical images have given rise to an increased interest in using quantitative imaging biomarkers to measure changes in these features. Critical to the performance of a quantitative imaging biomarker in preclinical or clinical settings are three primary metrology areas of interest: measurement linearity and bias, repeatability, and the ability to consistently reproduce equivalent results when conditions change, as would be expected in any clinical trial. Unfortunately, performance studies to date differ greatly in designs, analysis method, and metrics used to assess a quantitative imaging biomarker for clinical use. It is therefore difficult or not possible to integrate results from different studies or to use reported results to design studies. The Radiological Society of North America and the Quantitative Imaging Biomarker Alliance with technical, radiological, and statistical experts developed a set of technical performance analysis methods, metrics, and study designs that provide terminology, metrics, and methods consistent with widely accepted metrological standards. This document provides a consistent framework for the conduct and evaluation of quantitative imaging biomarker performance studies so that results from multiple studies can be compared, contrasted, or combined.},

We aimed to examine whether MRI-ASL kidney perfusion measurements are related to measurements of renal plasma flow (RPF) by para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) plasma clearance and whether changes of kidney perfusion in response to treatment with telmisartan can be detected by MRI-ASL.Twenty-four patients with metabolic syndrome and an estimated creatinine clearance according to Cockroft and Gault of > or =60 ml/min were included in the study. Kidney perfusion was assessed by MRI-ASL measurements of a single coronal kidney slice (with flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery and true fast imaging with steady-state processing sequence) and by measurements of RPF using PAH plasma clearance before and after 2 weeks of treatment with the angiotensin receptor blocker telmisartan. All MRI-ASL examinations were performed on a 1.5 T scanner.Two weeks of therapy with telmisartan led to a significant increase of RPF (from 313 +/- 47 to 348 +/- 69 ml/min/m, P = 0.007) and MRI-ASL kidney perfusion measurements (from 253 +/- 20 to 268 +/- 25 ml/min/100 g, P = 0.020). RPF measurements were related with MRI-ASL kidney perfusion measurements (r = 0.575, P < 0.001). Changes of RPF measurements and changes of MRI-ASL kidney perfusion measurements in response to treatment with telmisartan revealed a close relationship when expressed in absolute terms (r = 0.548, P = 0.015) and in percentage changes (r = 0.514, P = 0.025).Perfusion measurement of a single coronal kidney slice by MRI-ASL is able to approximate kidney perfusion and to approximate changes in kidney perfusion due to pharmacological intervention.},

  Abstract                 = {A major potential confound in axial 3D dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging studies is the blood inflow effect; therefore, the choice of slice location for arterial input function measurement within the imaging volume must be considered carefully. The objective of this study was to use computer simulations, flow phantom, and in vivo studies to describe and understand the effect of blood inflow on the measurement of the arterial input function. All experiments were done at 1.5 T using a typical 3D dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging sequence, and arterial input functions were extracted for each slice in the imaging volume. We simulated a set of arterial input functions based on the same imaging parameters and accounted for blood inflow and radiofrequency field inhomogeneities. Measured arterial input functions along the vessel length from both in vivo and the flow phantom agreed with simulated arterial input functions and show large overestimations in the arterial input function in the first 30 mm of the vessel, whereas arterial input functions measured more centrally achieve accurate contrast agent concentrations. Use of inflow-affected arterial input functions in tracer kinetic modeling shows potential errors of up to 80\% in tissue microvascular parameters. These errors emphasize the importance of careful placement of the arterial input function definition location to avoid the effects of blood inflow.},

  Abstract                 = {Total kidney volume (TKV) is an imaging biomarker that may have diagnostic and prognostic utility. The relationships between kidney volume, renal function and cardiovascular disease (CVD) have not been characterized in a large community-dwelling population.

A healthy sample was used to define reference values. The associations between TKV, renal function and CVD risk factors were determined using multivariable logistic regression analysis.Overall, mean TKV was 278 ± 54 cm(3) for women and 365 ± 66 cm(3) for men. Risk factors for high TKV (>90\% healthy referent size) were body surface area (BSA), diabetes, smoking and albuminuria, while age, female and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were protective. Participants with high TKV had higher odds of diabetes [odds ratio (OR) 2.15, P < 0.001] and lower odds of eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (OR 0.32, P = 0.007). Risk factors for low TKV (<10\% healthy referent size) were age, female and eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), while BSA and diabetes were protective.

QI is commonly used to inform patient diagnosis or prognosis, determine the choice of therapy, or monitor therapy response.

The Association of University Radiologists Radiology Research Alliance Quantitative Imaging Task Force has explored the clinical application of QI and summarizes its work in this review. We provide an overview of the clinical use of QI by discussing QI tools that are currently used in clinical practice, clinical applications of these tools, approaches to reporting of QI, and challenges to implementing QI. It is hoped that these insights will help radiologists recognize the tangible benefits of QI to their patients, their referring clinicians, and their own radiology practice.},

  Abstract                 = {The accuracy and precision of an automated graph-cuts (GC) segmentation technique for dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) 3D MR renography (MRR) was analyzed using 18 simulated and 22 clinical datasets. For clinical data, the error was 7.2 +/- 6.1 cm(3) for the cortex and 6.5 +/- 4.6 cm(3) for the medulla. The precision of segmentation was 7.1 +/- 4.2 cm(3) for the cortex and 7.2 +/- 2.4 cm(3) for the medulla. Compartmental modeling of kidney function in 22 kidneys yielded a renal plasma flow (RPF) error of 7.5\% +/- 4.5\% and single-kidney GFR error of 13.5\% +/- 8.8\%. The precision was 9.7\% +/- 6.4\% for RPF and 14.8\% +/- 11.9\% for GFR. It took 21 min to segment one kidney using GC, compared to 2.5 hr for manual segmentation. The accuracy and precision in RPF and GFR appear acceptable for clinical use. With expedited image processing, DCE 3D MRR has the potential to expand our knowledge of renal function in individual kidneys and to help diagnose renal insufficiency in a safe and noninvasive manner.},

This article reviews the most important recently published studies in selected topics chosen because of their clinical relevance or potential for technical developments.Magnetic resonance imaging is used increasingly to evaluate renal masses, the prenatal genitourinary system, urinary obstruction and infection, renal vasculature, and the kidneys of transplant donors and recipients. Dynamic contrast magnetic resonance renography based on gadolinium chelated to diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, a safe (non-nephrotoxic) paramagnetic agent, emerges as the functional renal imaging modality of choice. Both perfusion and filtration rates can be assessed in individual kidney.Magnetic resonance imaging has the potential to provide a complete anatomic, physiologic, kidney-specific evaluation. With future advances in automated image analysis methods we can expect functional renal magnetic resonance imaging to play an influential role in management of renal disease.},

BOLD MR imaging was performed in 40 patients with atherosclerotic RAS (age range, 51-83 years; 22 men, 18 women) and 32 patients with essential hypertension (EH) (age range, 26-85 years; 19 men, 13 women) during sodium intake and renin-angiotensin blockade. Fractional kidney hypoxia (percentage of entire axial image section with R2* above 30 sec(-1)) and conventional regional estimates of cortical and medullary R2* levels were measured. Stenotic and nonstenotic contralateral kidneys were compared for volume, tissue perfusion, and blood flow measured with multidetector computed tomography. Statistical analysis was performed (paired and nonpaired t tests, linear regression analysis).Stenotic RBF was reduced compared with RBF of contralateral kidneys (225.2 mL/min vs 348 mL/min, P = .0003). Medullary perfusion in atherosclerotic RAS patients was lower than in EH patients (1.07 mL/min per milliliter of tissue vs 1.3 mL/min per milliliter of tissue, P = .009). While observer-selected cortical R2* (18.9 sec(-1) [stenosis] vs 18.5 sec(-1) [EH], P = .07) did not differ, fractional kidney hypoxia was higher in stenotic kidneys compared with kidneys with EH (17.4\% vs 9.6\%, P < .0001) and contralateral kidneys (7.2\%, P < .0001). Fractional hypoxia correlated inversely with blood flow (r = -0.34), perfusion (r = -0.3), and GFR (r = -0.32).Fractional tissue hypoxia rather than cortical or medullary R2* values used to assess renal BOLD MR imaging demonstrated a direct relationship to chronically reduced blood flow and GFR.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is a widely used technique for assessing tissue physiology. Spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) pulse sequences are one of the most common methods for acquisition of DCE-MRI data, providing high temporal and spatial resolution with strong T(1)-weighting. Conversion of SPGR signal to concentration is briefly reviewed, and a new closed-form expression for concentration measurement uncertainty for finite signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and baseline scan time is derived. This result is applicable to arbitrary concentration-dependent relaxation rate and is valid over the same domain as the theoretical SPGR signal equation. Expressions for the lower and upper bounds on measurable concentration are also derived. The existence of a concentration- and tissue-dependent optimal flip angle that minimizes concentration uncertainty is demonstrated and it is shown that, for clinically relevant pulse sequence parameters, this optimal flip angle is significantly larger than the corresponding Ernst angle. Analysis of three pulse sequences from the DCE-MRI literature shows that optimization of flip angle using the methods discussed here leads to potential improvements of 10-1166\% in effective SNR over the 0.5-5.0 mM concentration range with minimal or no loss of measurement accuracy down to 0.1 mM. In vivo data from three study patients provide further support for our theoretical expression for concentration measurement uncertainty, with predicted and experimental estimates agreeing to within +/- 30\%. Equations for concentration bias resulting from biases in flip angle and from pre-contrast relaxation time and contrast relaxivity (both longitudinal and transverse) are also derived in closed-form. The resulting equations show the potential for significant contributions to bias in concentration measurement arising from even relatively small mis-specification of flip angle and/or pre-contrast longitudinal relaxation time, particularly at high contrast concentrations.},

  Abstract                 = {Imaging in clinical oncology trials provides a wealth of information that contributes to the drug development process, especially in early phase studies. This article focuses on kinetic modeling in DCE-MRI, inspired by mixed-effects models that are frequently used in the analysis of clinical trials. Instead of summarizing each scanning session as a single kinetic parameter--such as median k(trans) across all voxels in the tumor ROI-we propose to analyze all voxel time courses from all scans and across all subjects simultaneously in a single model. The kinetic parameters from the usual nonlinear regression model are decomposed into unique components associated with factors from the longitudinal study; e.g., treatment, patient, and voxel effects. A Bayesian hierarchical model provides the framework to construct a data model, a parameter model, as well as prior distributions. The posterior distribution of the kinetic parameters is estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Hypothesis testing at the study level for an overall treatment effect is straightforward and the patient- and voxel-level parameters capture random effects that provide additional information at various levels of resolution to allow a thorough evaluation of the clinical trial. The proposed method is validated with a breast cancer study, where the subjects were imaged before and after two cycles of chemotherapy, demonstrating the clinical potential of this method to longitudinal oncology studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is an important tool for detecting subtle kinetic changes in cancerous tissue. Quantitative analysis of DCE-MRI typically involves the convolution of an arterial input function (AIF) with a nonlinear pharmacokinetic model of the contrast agent concentration. Parameters of the kinetic model are biologically meaningful, but the optimization of the nonlinear model has significant computational issues. In practice, convergence of the optimization algorithm is not guaranteed and the accuracy of the model fitting may be compromised. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a semi-parametric penalized spline smoothing approach, where the AIF is convolved with a set of B-splines to produce a design matrix using locally adaptive smoothing parameters based on Bayesian penalized spline models (P-splines). It has been shown that kinetic parameter estimation can be obtained from the resulting deconvolved response function, which also includes the onset of contrast enhancement. Detailed validation of the method, both with simulated and in vivo data, is provided.},

Asymptotic results from likelihood-based nonlinear regression are compared with results derived from the posterior distribution using Bayesian estimation, along with the output from an established software package (MRIW). By using the estimated error from kinetic parameters, it is possible to produce more accurate clinical statistics, such as tumor size, for patients with breast tumors. Further analysis has also shown that Bayesian methods are more accurate and do not suffer from convergence problems, but at a higher computational cost.},

Qualitative image quality of the DCE-MR images and perfusion maps was independently scored by two abdominal radiologists using a 5-point scale (from 1, uninterpretable, to 5, very good). For quantitative analysis, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the liver and goodness-of-fit (GOF) of the time-intensity curve were measured.In the three tested sequences, DCE-MRI had good temporal (5 s) and spatial resolution (1.48 × 1.48 × 4 mm/voxel). Interobserver agreement in the qualitative analysis was good (ĸ = 0.753; 95\% confidence interval, 0.610-0.895). Therefore, the mean scores were used in the data analysis. Overall image quality was comparable between CAIPIRINHA-VIBE (3.52 ± 0.55) and KWIC-Radial-VIBE (3.72 ± 0.37; p = 1.000), and both were significantly better than c-VIBE (2.71 ± 0.34; p < 0.001). Perfusion map quality score was highest with KWIC-Radial-VIBE (4.33 ± 0.65), followed by CAIPIRINHA-VIBE (3.70 ± 0.73) and c-VIBE (3.14 ± 0.66), but without statistical significance between CAIPIRINHA-VIBE and KWIC-Radial-VIBE (p = 0.167). The SNR of the liver and GOF of the time-intensity curve did not significantly differ between the three sequences (p = 0.116 and 0.224, respectively).CAIPIRINHA-VIBE and KWIC-Radial-VIBE provide comparably better performance than c-VIBE. Both can be feasible sequences with acceptable good image quality for free-breathing DCE-MRI.CAIPIRINHA-VIBE and KWIC-Radial-VIBE provide comparably better quality of free-breathing DCE-MRIs than c-VIBE.},

The validity of this Fast-AP-based method was proved on two DCE-MRI datasets, i.e., rat kidney and human head and neck. The detailed AIF detection performance of this proposed method was assessed in comparison with other clustering-based methods, namely original AP and K-means, as well as the manual AIF detection method.Both the automatic AP- and Fast-AP-based methods achieved satisfactory AIF detection accuracy, but the computational cost of Fast-AP could be reduced by 64.37-92.10\% on rat dataset and 73.18-90.18\% on human dataset compared with the cost of AP. The K-means yielded the lowest computational cost, but resulted in the lowest AIF detection accuracy. The experimental results demonstrated that both the AP- and Fast-AP-based methods were insensitive to the initialization of cluster centers, and had superior robustness compared with K-means method.The Fast-AP-based method enables automatic AIF detection with high accuracy and efficiency.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) imaging is a widely used technique in oncologic imaging. An essential prerequisite for obtaining quantitative values from DCE-MRI is the determination of the arterial input function (AIF). However, it is very challenging to accurately estimate the AIF using MR. A comprehensive model, which uses complex data instead of either magnitude or phase, was developed to improve AIF estimation.The model was first applied to simulated data. Subsequently, the accuracy of the estimated contrast agent concentration was validated in a phantom. Finally the method was applied to existing DCE scans of 13 prostate cancer patients.The complex signal method combines the complementary strengths of the magnitude and phase method, increasing the precision and accuracy of concentration estimation in simulated and phantom data. The in vivo AIFs show a good agreement between arterial voxels (standard deviation in the peak and tail equal 0.4 mM and 0.12 mM, respectively). Furthermore, the dynamic behavior closely followed the AIF obtained with DCE-CT in the same patients (mean correlation coefficient: 0.92).By using the complex signal, the AIF estimation becomes more accurate and precise. This might enable patient specific AIFs, thereby improving the quantitative values obtained from DCE-MRI. Magn Reson Med 76:1236-1245, 2016. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

To explain the observed trends in the fitting errors, we present an argument about the conditioning of the Jacobian in the limit of small and large parameter values. We also demonstrate its use on an in vivo data set to measure performance on a realistic application. For a 192 × 192 breast image, we achieved run times of <1 s. Finally, we analyze run times scaling with problem size and find that the run time per voxel scales as O(N (1.9)), where N is the number of time points in the tissue concentration curve.

We present a spatial elastic net approach that allows to estimate the number of compartments for each voxel such that the model complexity is not fixed a priori. A multi-compartment approach is considered, which is translated into a restricted least square model selection problem. This is done by using a set of basis functions for a given set of candidate rate constants. The form of the basis functions is derived from a kinetic model and thus describes the contribution of a specific compartment. Using a spatial elastic net estimator, we chose a sparse set of basis functions per voxel, and hence, rate constants of compartments. The spatial penalty takes into account the voxel structure of an image and performs better than a penalty treating voxels independently. The proposed estimation method is evaluated for simulated images and applied to an in vivo dataset.},

The rules are derived from the physical principle of mass conservation, and the interpretation provided by the general tracer-kinetic theory of linear and stationary systems.

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) is a functional MRI method where T1 -weighted MR images are acquired dynamically after bolus injection of a contrast agent. The data can be interpreted in terms of physiological tissue characteristics by applying the principles of tracer-kinetic modelling. In the brain, DCE-MRI enables measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability-surface area product (PS) and the volume of the interstitium (ve ). These parameters can be combined to form others such as the volume-transfer constant K(trans) , the extraction fraction E and the contrast-agent mean transit times through the intra- and extravascular spaces. A first generation of tracer-kinetic models for DCE-MRI was developed in the early 1990s and has become a standard in many applications. Subsequent improvements in DCE-MRI data quality have driven the development of a second generation of more complex models. They are increasingly used, but it is not always clear how they relate to the models of the first generation or to the model-free deconvolution methods for tissues with intact BBB. This lack of understanding is leading to increasing confusion on when to use which model and how to interpret the parameters. The purpose of this review is to clarify the relation between models of the first and second generations and between model-based and model-free methods. All quantities are defined using a generic terminology to ensure the widest possible scope and to reveal the link between applications in the brain and in other organs.},

  Abstract                 = {The tracer-kinetic models developed in the early 1990s for dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) have since become a standard in numerous applications. At the same time, the development of MRI hardware has led to increases in image quality and temporal resolution that reveal the limitations of the early models. This in turn has stimulated an interest in the development and application of a second generation of modelling approaches. They are designed to overcome these limitations and produce additional and more accurate information on tissue status. In particular, models of the second generation enable separate estimates of perfusion and capillary permeability rather than a single parameter K(trans) that represents a combination of the two. A variety of such models has been proposed in the literature, and development in the field has been constrained by a lack of transparency regarding terminology, notations and physiological assumptions. In this review, we provide an overview of these models in a manner that is both physically intuitive and mathematically rigourous. All are derived from common first principles, using concepts and notations from general tracer-kinetic theory. Explicit links to their historical origins are included to allow for a transfer of experience obtained in other fields (PET, SPECT, CT). A classification is presented that reveals the links between all models, and with the models of the first generation. Detailed formulae for all solutions are provided to facilitate implementation. Our aim is to encourage the application of these tools to DCE-MRI by offering researchers a clearer understanding of their assumptions and requirements.},

  Abstract                 = {The Tofts model (TM) and extended Tofts model (ETM) have become a standard for the analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. In this study, a mathematical analysis is used to identify exactly in which tissue types the Tofts models may be applied. The results show that the TM is accurate if and only if the tissue is weakly vascularised (small blood volume). The ETM is additionally accurate in highly perfused tissues (high blood flow). In tissues that are highly vascularised, or where tracer exchange is very fast or very slow, TM and ETM accurately fit the data but lead to a misinterpretation of the parameters. In tissue types with intermediate vascularity, perfusion and tracer exchange, neither model offers a good fit to the tissue concentrations. A good fit can be obtained with a measured input function by reducing the temporal resolution, but this does not improve the accuracy of the parameters. In conclusion, the Tofts models only produce reliable parameter values if the tissue is weakly vascularized (TM or ETM) or highly perfused (ETM). Without prior knowledge that at least one of these constraints is fulfilled, the physiological interpretation of the values produced by the Tofts models is unclear.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent animal studies with dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging have demonstrated that a separable compartment model provides more accurate assessments of glomerular filtration than the Patlak model. In this study, the feasibility of the separable compartment model for the measurement of perfusion and filtration in healthy humans is investigated.Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 15 healthy volunteers. Contrast enhancement curves were analyzed with the separable compartment model on whole kidney regions, cortex regions, and the pixel level. The region of interest values for the kinetic parameters were compared with those obtained from the Patlak model and from a model-free deconvolution analysis.The separable compartment model provides a good fit to the data over the entire dynamic range. All values of filtration (30 +/- 7.2 and 20 +/- 11 mL/100 mL/Min for kidney and cortex, respectively) are significantly higher than those of the Patlak model (24 +/- 6.4 and 15 +/- 11 mL/100 mL/Min). Values produced by the Patlak model have a higher variability. Whole kidney values of perfusion (229 +/- 57 mL/100 mL/Min) are significantly higher than those of a deconvolution analysis (210 +/- 50 mL/100 mL/Min).The separable compartment model is feasible for application in humans and sufficiently robust for a pixel analysis. Increased filtration values compared with the Patlak model suggest that the difference in accuracy observed in animal studies is relevant in humans. Increased perfusion values suggest that the separable compartment model corrects for known underestimations in the deconvolution analysis.},

Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be applied for early and non-invasive therapy monitoring by non-invasive quantitative assessment of tumor microcirculation as in vivo imaging biomarkers of therapy response.To monitor the anti-angiogenic effects of a novel combination therapy on experimental head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) with dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI.Athymic rats (n = 18) with subcutaneous HNSCC xenografts were investigated by DCE-MRI before and after 7 days of a daily triple therapy regimen combining the COX-II-inhibitor celecoxib, the matrix-metalloproteinase-inhibitor GM6001, and the uPA-inhibitor upamostat. Quantitative measurements of tumor blood flow (tBF), tumor blood volume (tBV), and permeability-surface area product (PS) were calculated and validated by immunohistochemistry.Mean tBF and tBV in triple-therapy animals decreased significantly from day 0 to day 7 (tBF, 41.0 ± 14.2 to 20.4 ± 5.7 mL/100 mL/min; P < 0.01; tBV, 17.7 ± 3.9 to 7.5 ± 3.3\%; P < 0.01). No significant effects on PS were observed in either group (P > 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis showed a significantly lower tumor vascularity in the therapy group than in the control group (CD31), significantly fewer Ki-67+ proliferating tumor cells and significantly more Capase-3+ apoptotic tumor cells (P < 0.05). Significant (P < 0.05) correlations were observed between tBF/tBV and CD31 (tBF, r = 0.84; tBV, r = 0.70), tBV and Ki-67 (r = 0.62), as well as tBF and caspase-3 (r = -0.64).DCE-MRI may be a suitable tool for the non-invasive monitoring of the anti-vascular effects of this innovative triple therapy regimen with potential for clinical translation.},

Hereby nine volunteers were examined at three different physiological states of urinary bladder filling (a normal state, urinary urgency, and immediately after urinary relief). Mechanical imaging was performed of the in vivo kidney using three-dimensional multifrequency magnetic resonance elastography combined with multifrequency dual elastovisco inversion. Other than in classical elastography, where the storage and loss shear moduli are evaluated, we analyzed the magnitude |G(⁎)| and the phase angle φ of the complex shear modulus reconstructed by simultaneous inversion of full wave field data corresponding to 7 harmonic drive frequencies from 30 to 60Hz and a resolution of 2.5mm cubic voxel size. Mechanical parameter maps were derived with a spatial resolution superior to that in previous work. The group-averaged values of |G(⁎)| were 2.67±0.52kPa in the renal medulla, 1.64±0.17kPa in the cortex, and 1.17±0.21kPa in the hilus. The phase angle φ (in radians) was 0.89±0.12 in the medulla, 0.83±0.09 in the cortex, and 0.72±0.06 in the hilus. All regional differences were significant (P<0.001), while no significant variation was found in relation to different stages of bladder filling. In summary our study provides first high-resolution maps of viscoelastic parameters of the three anatomical regions of the kidney. |G(⁎)| and φ provide novel information on the viscoelastic properties of the kidney, which is potentially useful for the detection of renal lesions or fibrosis.},

  Abstract                 = {The pharmacokinetic parameters derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI have been used in more than 100 phase I trials and investigator led studies. A comparison of the absolute values of these quantities requires an estimation of their respective probability distribution function (PDF). The statistical variation of the DCE-MRI measurement is analyzed by considering the fundamental sources of error in the MR signal intensity acquired with the spoiled gradient-echo (SPGR) pulse sequence.The variance in the SPGR signal intensity arises from quadrature detection and excitation flip angle inconsistency. The noise power was measured in 11 phantoms of contrast agent concentration in the range [0-1] mM (in steps of 0.1 mM) and in onein vivo acquisition of a tumor-bearing mouse. The distribution of the flip angle was determined in a uniform 10 mM CuSO4 phantom using the spin echo double angle method. The PDF of a wide range of T1 values measured with the varying flip angle (VFA) technique was estimated through numerical simulations of the SPGR equation. The resultant uncertainty in contrast agent concentration was incorporated in the most common model of tracer exchange kinetics and the PDF of the derived pharmacokinetic parameters was studied numerically.The VFA method is an unbiased technique for measuringT1 only in the absence of bias in excitation flip angle. The time-dependent concentration of the contrast agent measured in vivo is within the theoretically predicted uncertainty. The uncertainty in measuring K(trans) with SPGR pulse sequences is of the same order, but always higher than, the uncertainty in measuring the pre-injection longitudinal relaxation time (T10). The lowest achievable bias/uncertainty in estimating this parameter is approximately 20\%-70\% higher than the bias/uncertainty in the measurement of the pre-injection T1 map. The fractional volume parameters derived from the extended Tofts model were found to be extremely sensitive to the variance in signal intensity. The SNR of the pre-injection T1 map indicates the limiting precision with which K(trans) can be calculated.Current small-animal imaging systems and pulse sequences robust to motion artifacts have the capacity for reproducible quantitative acquisitions with DCE-MRI. In these circumstances, it is feasible to achieve a level of precision limited only by physiologic variability.},

  Abstract                 = {Traditional imaging assessment criteria might not correlate well with clinical benefit from vascular endothelial growth factor pathway-directed therapy in metastatic renal cancer. Preclinical data suggest tumor growth is preceded by a rise in K(trans) level, a parameter derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that reflects vascular permeability. We thus hypothesized that K(trans) might be a predictive biomarker for pazopanib.Patients with metastatic renal cancer were treated with pazopanib at 800 mg oral daily until disease progression. MRI of the abdomen and pelvis with a DCE-MRI sequence was obtained at baseline and every 8 weeks.Seventy-three DCE-MRI scans were completed and 66 were technically assessable. Of the 17 patients with at least 1 DCE-MRI scan after the baseline scan, 16 (94\%) had a decline in K(trans) level. Changes in K(trans) compared with baseline after 1, 8, 16, and 24 weeks were -49\%, -65\%, -63\%, and -53\%, respectively (P = .0052, repeated measures analysis of variance). The median K(trans) nadir occurred at 8 weeks. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 32.1 weeks. PFS was longer in patients with higher baseline K(trans) values (P = .036, log rank). Baseline K(trans) did not reach significance in a Cox proportional hazard model including clinical prognostic index and previous treatments (P = .083).We show that K(trans) is a pharmacodynamic biomarker for pazopanib therapy in metastatic renal cancer. Because of the small sample size, the predictive capacity of K(trans) recovery could not be assessed, but baseline K(trans) correlated with PFS.},

  Abstract                 = {The pharmacokinetics (PK) of the contrast agent Gd-DTPA administered intravenously (i.v.) for contrast-enhanced MR imaging (DCE-MRI) is an important factor for quantitative data acquisition. We studied the effect of various initial bolus doses on the PK of Gd-DTPA and analyzed population PK of a lower dose for intra-subject variations in DCE-MRI. First, fifteen subjects (23-85years, M/F) were randomly divided into four groups for DCE-MRI with different Gd-DTPA dose: group-I, 0.1mmol/kg, n=4; group-II, 0.05mmol/kg, n=4; group-III, 0.025mmol/kg, n=4; and group-IV, 0.0125mmol/kg, n=3. Sequential fast T1 mapping sequence, after a bolus i.v. Gd-DTPA administered, and a linear T1-[Gd-DTPA] relationship were used to estimate the PK of Gd-DTPA. Secondly, MR-acquired PKs of Gd-DTPA from 58 subjects (28-80years, M/F) were collected retrospectively, from an ongoing study of the brain using DCE-MRI with Gd-DTPA at 0.025mmol/kg, to statistically analyze population PK of Gd-DTPA. We found that the PK of Gd-DTPA (i.v. 0.025mmol/kg) had a half-life of 37.3±6.6min, and was a better fit into a linear T1-[Gd-DTPA] relationship than higher doses (up to 0.1mmol/kg). The area under the curve (AUC) for 0.025mmol/kg was 3.37±0.46, which was a quarter of AUC of 0.1mmol/kg. In population analysis, a dose of 0.025mmol/kg of Gd-DTPA provided less than 5\% subject-dependent variation in the PK of Gd-DTPA. Administration of 0.025mmol/kg Gd-DTPA enabled us to estimate [Gd-DTPA] from T1 by using a linear relationship that has a lower estimation error compared to a non-linear relationship. DCE-MRI with a quarter dose of Gd-DTPA is more sensitive to detect changes in [Gd-DTPA].},

These MRI techniques show great promise, enabling the noninvasive assessment of renal structure, function and injury in individuals. This review will highlight the current applications of functional MRI techniques for the assessment of renal disease and discuss future directions.Many pathological (functional and structural) changes or factors in renal disease can be assessed by advanced MRI techniques. These include renal vascular structure and function (contrast-enhanced MRI, arterial spin labelling), tissue oxygenation (blood oxygen level dependent MRI), renal tissue injury and fibrosis (diffusion or magnetization transfer imaging, magnetic resonance elastography), renal metabolism (chemical exchange saturation transfer, spectroscopic imaging), nephron endowment (cationic-contrast imaging), sodium concentration (23Na-MRI) and molecular events (targeted-contrast imaging).Current advances in MRI techniques have enabled the noninvasive investigation of renal disease. Further development, evaluation and application of the MRI techniques should facilitate better understanding and assessment of renal disease, and the development of new imaging biomarkers, enabling the intensified treatment of high-risk populations and a more rapid interrogation of novel therapeutic agents and protocols.},

  Abstract                 = {Renal dysfunction may be related to cerebral small-vessel disease. This study aimed to assess the relationship between mild renal dysfunction and various white matter hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A total of 2106 subjects (1368 men and 738 women; mean age, 56 ± 10 years) without a history of stroke were enrolled in the study. Kidney function was evaluated in terms of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calculated using the relationship 194Cr(-1.094) × age(-0.287) × 0.739 (if female), where Cr is serum creatinine concentration. White matter hyperintensity on T2-weighted MRI was classified as deep and/or subcortical white matter hyperintensity (DSWMH), periventricular hyperintensity (PVH), or asymptomatic cerebral infarction (ACI). The prevalence of ACI, DSWMH, and PVH was significantly correlated with degree of eGFR reduction; in the subgroups with eGFR ≥ 90, 60∼89, and <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), the following prevalences were found: ACI, 7\%, 6\%, and 16\%; DSWMH, 18\%, 21\%, and 37\%; PVH: 7\%, 10\%, and 21\%. The odds ratios for ACI, DSWMH, and PVH of eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were significantly increased, to 2.11 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-3.61; P = .006), 2.26 (1.53-3.34; P < .001), and 2.81 (1.67-4.72; P < .001), respectively. Our data indicate that mild renal dysfunction may be associated with an increase in cerebral small-vessel disease independent of hypertension.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this study was to determine a robust (sensitive and objective) method for analyzing renal blood oxygenation level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging data.Forty-seven subjects (30 with chronic kidney disease [CKD] and 17 controls) were imaged at baseline and after furosemide with a multiecho gradient recalled echo sequence. Conventional analysis consisted of regional segmentation (small cortex, large cortex, and medulla), followed by computing the mean of each region. In addition, we segmented the entire parenchyma and computed the mean (μ1) plus higher moments (μ2, μ3, and μ4). Two raters performed each of the segmentation steps, and agreement was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). We used a measure of effect size (Cohen's d value), in addition to the usual measure of statistical significance, P values, for determining significant results.The mean of the renal parenchyma showed the highest agreement between raters (ICC, 0.99), and the higher parenchyma moments were on par with large cortical region of interest (ROI) ICC. The renal parenchymal mean also exhibited significant sensitivity to changes after furosemide administration in healthy subjects (P = 0.002, d = 0.84), in agreement with medullary ROIs (P = 0.002, d = 1.59). When comparing controls and subjects with CKD at baseline, cortical ROI showed a significant difference (P = 0.015, d = -0.69), whereas the parenchyma ROI did not (P = 0.152, d = 0.39). Post-furosemide data in all regions resulted in a significant difference (large cortex: P = 0.026, d = -0.51; medulla: P = 0.019, d = -0.61) with the renal parenchyma ROI resulting in the largest effect size (P = 0.003, d = -0.75). Higher moments of the renal parenchyma showed similar significant differences as well.Overall, our data support the use of the entire parenchyma to evaluate changes in the medulla after administration of furosemide, a widely used pharmacological maneuver. Changes in higher moments indicate that there is more than just a shift in the mean renal R2* and may provide clinically relevant information without the need for subjective regional segmentation. For evaluating differences between controls and subjects with CKD at baseline; large cortical ROI provided the highest sensitivity and objectivity. A combination of renal parenchyma assessment and large cortical ROI may provide the most robust method of evaluating renal blood oxygenation level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging data.},

These include detailed models of practically all renal cell types and nephron segments and a variety of models of nephro-vascular exchanges in the medulla, of renal hemodynamics, and studies of tubuloglomerular feedback and autoregulation. Recent detailed anatomical reconstructions have brought surprising new results to bear on classic unsolved problems. In parallel with the modeling environment, progress has been made toward the quantitative database and model repository resources that must accompany the modeling environment in order to attain the goal of an open-ended, flexible, and collaborative infrastructure for renal systems biology, with an indication of prospects for integration with initiatives in the larger IUPS Physiome Project.},

However, enthusiasm for this relatively newGFRtest may be curbed by the limited amount of cross-calibration studies with referenceGFRtechniques and the vast variety ofMRtracer model algorithms causing confusion on the choice of model. To advanceMRI-basedGFRquantification via improvedGFRmodeling and comparison with associated(99m)Tc-DTPA-GFR, 29 long-term Wilms' tumor survivors (19.0-43.3 years, [median 32.0 ± 6.0 years]) treated with nephrectomy, nonnephrotoxic chemotherapy ± radiotherapy underwentMRIwith Gd-DTPAadministration and a(99m)Tc-DTPA GFRtest. ForDCE-MRI-basedGFRestimation, a subject-specific two-compartment (SS-2C) model was developed that uses individual hematocrit values, automatically defines subject-specific uptake intervals, and fits tracer-uptake curves by incorporating these measures. The association between reference(99m)Tc-DTPA GFRandMR-GFRs obtained bySS-2C, three published 2C uptake, and inflow-outflow models was investigated via linear regression analysis. Uptake intervals varied from 64 sec to 141 sec [96 sec ± 21 sec] and hematocrit values ranged from 30\% to 49\% [41\% ± 4\%]; these parameters can therefore not be assumed as constants in 2C modeling. OurMR-GFRestimates using theSS-2C model showed accordingly the highest correlation with(99m)Tc-DTPA-GFRs (R(2) = 0.76,P < 0.001) compared with other models (R(2)-range: 0.36-0.66). In conclusion,SS-2C modeling ofDCE-MRIdata improved the association betweenGFRobtained by(99m)Tc-DTPAand Gd-DTPA DCE-MRIto such a degree that this approach could turn into a viable, diagnosticGFRassay without radiation exposure to the patient.},

Four physiological parameters can be estimated: regional filtration K ( trans ) (ml min(-1) [ml tissue](-1)), perfusion F (ml min(-1) [100 ml tissue](-1)), blood volume v ( b ) (\%) and mean residence time MRT (s). From these are found the filtration fraction (FF; \%) and total GFR (ml min(-1)). Fifteen healthy volunteers were imaged twice using oblique coronal slices every 2.5 s to determine the reproducibility.Using parenchymal ROIs, group mean values for renal biomarkers all agreed with published values: K ( trans ): 0.25; F: 219; v ( b ): 34; MRT: 5.5; FF: 15; GFR: 115. Nominally cortical ROIs consistently underestimated total filtration (by ~50\%). Reproducibility was 7-18\%. Sensitivity analysis showed that these fitted parameters are most vulnerable to errors in the fixed parameters kidney T(1), flip angle, haematocrit and relaxivity.These renal biomarkers can potentially measure renal physiology in diagnosis and treatment.• Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging can measure renal function. • Filtration and perfusion values in healthy volunteers agree with published normal values. • Precision measured in healthy volunteers is between 7 and 15\%.},

  Abstract                 = {Angiogenesis plays a fundamental role in cancer growth and the formation of metastasis. Novel cancer therapies aimed at inhibiting angiogenic processes and/or disrupting angiogenic tumor vasculature are currently being developed and clinically tested. The need for earlier and improved cancer diagnosis, and for early evaluation and monitoring of therapeutic response to angiogenic treatment have led to the development of several imaging methods for in-vivo non-invasive assessment of angiogenesis. The combination of dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging with mathematical modeling of the contrast agent kinetics enables quantitative assessment of the structural and functional changes in the microvasculature that are associated with tumor angiogenesis. In this paper, we review quantitative imaging of angiogenesis with dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), computed tomography (DCE-CT), and ultrasound (DCE-US).},

  Abstract                 = {The Fast Spoiled Gradient Echo (FSPGR) sequence is often used in MRI to create T1-weighted images. The signal intensity generated by this sequence depends on the applied flip angle. Knowing the correct flip angle is essential for the determination of T1-maps by means of an FSPGR based Variable Flip Angle (VFA) approach. Also, quantitatively determining the concentration of contrast agent in case of Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) requires knowledge of the applied flip angle. In both cases, the B1-field (in)homogeneity significantly affects the results. In this paper, we present a new method to obtain both the T1-map and B1-inhomogeneity map using scans that can each be acquired within a breath-hold. We combine two short sequences for T1 quantification: Variable Flip Angle and Look-Locker (LL). The T1-maps obtained from the LL data were used to estimate the B1-inhomogeneity inherently present in the VFA data, which was then used to correct for the VFA method's inaccurate flip angles. This way, a reliable T1-map could be computed, which was validated using both in vitro and in vivo scans. The in vitro results show that the procedure yields a substantially smaller mean deviation in T1 from the T1 measurement's gold standard (the Inversion Recovery method), while the in vivo results show both a more accurate estimation of T1 and a reduction of the influence of the B1-inhomogeneity on the signal intensity.},

  Abstract                 = {Glucose is the principal source of energy for the brain and yet the dynamic response of glucose utilization to changes in brain activity is still not fully understood. Positron emission tomography (PET) allows quantitative measurement of glucose metabolism using 2-[(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). However, FDG PET in its current form provides an integral (or average) of glucose consumption over tens of minutes and lacks the temporal information to capture physiological alterations associated with changes in brain activity induced by tasks or drug challenges. Traditionally, changes in glucose utilization are inferred by comparing two separate scans, which significantly limits the utility of the method. We report a novel method to track changes in FDG metabolism dynamically, with higher temporal resolution than exists to date and within a single session. Using a constant infusion of FDG, we demonstrate that our technique (termed fPET-FDG) can be used in an analysis pipeline similar to fMRI to define within-session differential metabolic responses. We use visual stimulation to demonstrate the feasibility of this method. This new method has a great potential to be used in research protocols and clinical settings since fPET-FDG imaging can be performed with most PET scanners and data acquisition and analysis are straightforward. fPET-FDG is a highly complementary technique to MRI and provides a rich new way to observe functional changes in brain metabolism.},

  Abstract                 = {The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sympathetic nervous system are key factors in the pathophysiology of hypertension. Renal hypoxia is the putative mechanism stimulating both systems. Blood oxygen level-dependent MRI (BOLD-MRI) provides a noninvasive tool to determine renal oxygenation in humans. The aim of the current study was to investigate the relation between blood pressure (BP) and kidney function with renal BOLD-MRI. Moreover, the relation between direct and indirect variables of the RAAS and sympathetic nervous system and renal BOLD-MRI was studied.Seventy-five hypertensive patients (38 men) were included. Antihypertensive medication was temporarily stopped. Patients collected urine during 24 h (sodium, catecholamines), blood samples were taken (creatinine, renin, aldosterone), a captopril challenge test was performed, and ambulatory BP was measured.Mean age was 58 (±11) years, day-time BP was 167 (±19)/102 (±16) mmHg, and estimated glomerular filtration rate was 75 (±18) ml/min per 1.73 m). In multivariable regression analysis, renal medullary R2*-values inversely related to estimated glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.02). Moreover, the BP-lowering effect of captopril positively related to cortical (P = 0.02) and medullary (P = 0.008) R2*-values, as well as to P90 (P = 0.02).In patients with hypertension, kidney function relates to medullary R2*-values. Activation of the RAAS is also positively related to the renal R2*-values.},

The best-characterized existing GFR markers, including creatinine, radiolabeled markers, and iohexol, are reviewed in depth, as well as alternative but lesser used techniques. A weighted means analysis of reported GFR measurements in healthy dogs and cats and a review of selected studies that have examined GFR alterations in animals with naturally occurring and experimental diseases provide the reader with preliminary guidelines on expected GFR results in these species and disease conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {The objective of this study was to investigate the intra- and interobserver as well as scan-rescan reproducibility of quantitative parameters of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) with dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). A total of 21 patients with clear cell RCCs (17 men, 4 woman; age 37-69 years, mean age 54.6 years, mean size, 5.0 ± 2.2 cm) were prospectively recruited from September 2012 to November 2012. Patients underwent paired DCE-MRI studies on a 3.0 T MR system with an interval of 48 to 72 hours. The extended-Tofts model and population-based arterial input function were used to calculate kinetic parameters. Three observers defined the 2-dimensional whole-tumor region of interest at the slice with the maximum diameter of the RCC. Intraobserver and scan-rescan differences were assessed using paired t tests, whereas interobserver differences using two-way analysis of variance. Intra- and interobserver reproducibility and scan-rescan reproducibility were evaluated using within-subject coefficient of variation (wCoV) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). There were no significant intra-, interobserver, or scan-rescan differences in parameters (all P > 0.05). All ICCs for intra- and interobserver agreements were >0.75 (P < 0.05), whereas the scan-rescan agreement was moderate to good; V(e) (0.764, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.378-0.925) and K(ep) (0.906, 95\% CI: 0.710-0.972) had higher ICC than K(trans) (0.686; 95\% CI: 0.212-0.898) and V(p) (0.657; 95\% CI: 0.164-0.888). In intra- and interobserver variability analyses, all parameters except V(p) had low wCoV values. K(trans) and V(e) had slightly lower intraobserver wCoV (1.2\% and 0.9\%) compared with K(ep) (3.7\%), whereas all 3 of these parameters had similar interobserver wCoV values (2.5\%, 3.1\%, and 2.9\%, respectively). Regarding scan-rescan variability, K(trans) and K(ep) showed slightly higher variation (15.6\% and 15.4\%) than V(e) (10.1\%). V(p) had the largest wCoV in all variability analyses (all >30\%). DCE-MRI demonstrated good intra- and interobserver reproducibility and moderate to good scan-rescan performance in the assessment of RCC using K(trans), K(ep), and V(e) as parameters under noncontinuous scanning mode. V(p) showed poor reproducibility, and thus may not be suitable for this scanning protocol.},

  Abstract                 = {Pharmacokinetic parameters derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) have been increasingly used to evaluate the permeability of tumor vessel. Histogram metrics are a recognized promising method of quantitative MR imaging that has been recently introduced in analysis of DCE-MRI pharmacokinetic parameters in oncology due to tumor heterogeneity. In this study, 21 patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) underwent paired DCE-MRI studies on a 3.0 T MR system. Extended Tofts model and population-based arterial input function were used to calculate kinetic parameters of RCC tumors. Mean value and histogram metrics (Mode, Skewness and Kurtosis) of each pharmacokinetic parameter were generated automatically using ImageJ software. Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility and scan-rescan reproducibility were evaluated using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and coefficient of variation (CoV). Our results demonstrated that the histogram method (Mode, Skewness and Kurtosis) was not superior to the conventional Mean value method in reproducibility evaluation on DCE-MRI pharmacokinetic parameters (K( trans) &Ve) in renal cell carcinoma, especially for Skewness and Kurtosis which showed lower intra-, inter-observer and scan-rescan reproducibility than Mean value. Our findings suggest that additional studies are necessary before wide incorporation of histogram metrics in quantitative analysis of DCE-MRI pharmacokinetic parameters.},

ASL measurements at two different inversion times and four different flow rates in the range of 70-210 mL/100 mL*minute were performed. Absolute values of blood flow and arterial transit times were determined in the kidney cortex.The quantitative values were in good agreement with the reference values obtained after calibration of the total flow. The greatest difference observed was 13\%.Isolated organ hemoperfusion allows validating perfusion imaging techniques. The experimental setup enables long-term radiotherapeutic or toxicological studies using noninvasive ASL to monitor blood flow quantitatively.},

Two data sets (each acquired in one breath-hold) were co-registered using a rigid registration algorithm compensating for possible breathing-related displacements. An automatic algorithm based on thresholding and shape detection segmented the kidneys into their compartments and was compared to a manual labeling procedure.The resulting kidney volumes of the automated segmentation correlated well with those created manually (R(2) = 0.96). Average volume errors were determined to be 4.97 ± 4.08\% (entire kidney parenchyma), 7.03 ± 5.56\% (cortex), 12.33 ± 7.35\% (medulla), and 17.57 ± 14.47\% (pelvis). The variation of the kidney volume resulting from the automatic algorithm was found to be 4.76\% based on the measuring of one volunteer with three independent examinations.The results demonstrate the feasibility of an accurate and repeatable automatic segmentation of the kidneys and their internal structures from non-contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images.},

Gadolinium (Gd)-DTPA was administered in two separate injections to decouple measurement of the arterial input function and tissue uptake curves. For DCE perfusion, pixel-wise and mean cortex region-of-interest tissue curves were fit to a separable compartment model.Absolute renal cortex perfusion estimates obtained by DCE and ASL were in close agreement: 3.28 ± 0.59 mL/g/min (ASL), 2.98 ± 0.60 mL/g/min (DCE), and 3.57 ± 0.96 mL/g/min (pixel-wise DCE). Renal medulla perfusion was 1.53 ± 0.35 mL/g/min (ASL) but was not adequately described by the separable compartment model.ASL and DCE-MRI provided similar measures of absolute perfusion in the renal cortex, offering both noncontrast and contrast-based alternatives to improve current renal MRI assessment of kidney function.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this study was to compare single-slice and 3-dimensional (3D) analysis for magnetic resonance renography (plasma flow [FP], plasma volume [VP], and glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) and for dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of renal tumors (FP, VP, permeability-surface area product), respectively.We prospectively included 22 patients (43 kidneys with 22 suspicious renal lesions) and performed preoperative and postoperative imaging before and after partial nephrectomy, respectively. Of the 22 renal lesions, 15 turned out to be renal cell carcinoma and were included in the tumor analysis, altogether leading to 86 renal and 15 tumor MRI scans, respectively. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was performed with a time-resolved angiography with stochastic trajectories sequence (spatial resolution, 2.6 × 2.6 × 2.6 mm3; temporal resolution, 2.5 seconds) at 3 T (Magnetom Verio; Siemens Healthcare Sector) after injection of 0.05 mmol/kg body weight Gadobutrol (Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals). Analysis was performed using regions of interest encompassing a single central slice and the whole kidney/tumor, respectively. A 2-compartment model yielding FP, VP, GFR, or tumor permeability-surface area product was used for kinetic modelling. Modelling was performed based on relative contrast enhancement to account for coil-related inhomogeneity. Significance in difference, agreement, and goodness of fit of the data to the curve was assessed with paired t tests, Bland-Altman plots, and χ2 test, respectively.Bland-Altman analysis revealed a good agreement between both types of measurement for kidneys and tumors, respectively. Results between single-slice and whole-kidney regions of interest showed significant differences for Fp (single slice, 256.1 ± 104.1 mL/100 mL/min; whole kidney, 217.2 ± 92.5 mL/100 mL/min; P < 0.01). Regarding VP and GFR, no significant differences were observed. The χ2 test showed a significantly better goodness of fit of the data to the curve for whole kidneys (0.30\% ± 0.18\%) than for single slices (0.43\% ± 0.26\%) (P < 0.01). In contrast to renal assessment, tumor analysis showed no significant differences regarding functional parameters and χ test, respectively.In dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI of the kidney, both 3D whole-organ/tumor and single-slice analyses provide roughly comparable values in functional analysis. However, 3D assessment is considerably more precise and should be preferred if available.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is a potentially powerful tool for analysis of kidney structure and function. The ability to measure functional and hypofunctional tissues could provide important information in groups at risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD), such as the elderly.Observational study with a cross-sectional design.493 volunteers (aged 72-94 years; 278 women; mean estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], 67±15mL/min/1.73m(2); 40\% with CKD) in the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility (AGES)-Reykjavik Study.DCE-MRI kidney segmentation data.eGFR, urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR), and risk factors for and complications of CKD.After adjustment for age, sex, and height, eGFR was related to kidney volume (ΔR²=0.19; P<0.001), cortex volume (ΔR²=0.14; P<0.001), medulla volume (ΔR²=0.18; P<0.001), and volume percentages of fibrosis (ΔR²=0.03; P<0.001) and fat (ΔR²=0.01; P=0.03). In similarly adjusted models, log(ACR) was related to kidney volume (ΔR²=0.02; P<0.001) and fibrosis volume percentage (ΔR²=0.03; P<0.001). Using multivariable regression models adjusted for eGFR, ACR, age, sex, and height, kidney volume was related positively to body mass index (B=29.9±2.1[SE]mL; P<0.001), smoking (B=19.7±7.7mL; P=0.01), and diabetes mellitus (B=14.8±7.1mL; P=0.04) and negatively to hematocrit (B=-4.4±2.1mL; P=0.04 [model R²=0.72; P<0.001]); relations were per 1-SD greater value of the variable. Fibrosis volume percentage was associated positively with body mass index (B=0.28±0.03; P<0.001), cardiac output (B=0.15±0.03; P<0.001), and heart rate (B=0.08±0.03; P=0.01) and negatively with hematocrit (B=-0.07±0.3; P=0.02) and augmentation index (B=-0.06±0.03; P=0.04 [model R²=0.49; P<0.001]); again, relations are per 1-SD greater value of the variable.Automatic segmentations were not validated by histology. The limited age range prevented meaningful interpretation of age effects on measured data or the automatic segmentation procedure.Kidney volume, cortex volume, and hypofunctional volume fraction assessed by DCE-MRI may provide information about CKD risk and prognosis beyond that provided by eGFR and urine ACR.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations of the kidneys provide quantitative information on renal perfusion and filtration. However, these examinations are often difficult to implement because of respiratory motion and their need for a high spatiotemporal resolution and 3-dimensional coverage. Here, we present a free-breathing quantitative renal DCE-MRI examination acquired with a highly accelerated stack-of-stars trajectory and reconstructed with 3-dimensional (3D) through-time radial generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisition (GRAPPA), using half and quarter doses of gadolinium contrast.Data were acquired in 10 asymptomatic volunteers using a stack-of-stars trajectory that was undersampled in-plane by a factor of 12.6 with respect to Nyquist sampling criterion and using partial Fourier of 6/8 in the partition direction. Data had a high temporal (2.1-2.9 seconds per frame) and spatial (approximately 2.2 mm) resolution with full 3D coverage of both kidneys (350-370 mm × 79-92 mm). Images were successfully reconstructed with 3D through-time radial GRAPPA, and interframe respiratory motion was compensated by using an algorithm developed to automatically use images from multiple points of enhancement as references for registration. Quantitative pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using a separable dual-compartment model.Region-of-interest (ROI) pharmacokinetic analysis provided estimates (mean (SD)) of quantitative renal parameters after a half dose: 218.1 (57.1) mL/min per 100 mL; plasma mean transit time, 4.8 (2.2) seconds; renal filtration, 28.7 (10.0) mL/min per 100 mL; and tubular mean transit time, 131.1 (60.2) seconds in 10 kidneys. The ROI pharmacokinetic analysis provided estimates (mean (SD)) of quantitative renal parameters after a quarter dose: 218.1 (57.1) mL/min per 100 mL; plasma mean transit time, 4.8 (2.2) seconds; renal filtration, 28.7 (10.0) mL/min per 100 mL; and tubular mean transit time, 131.1 (60.2) seconds in the 10 kidneys. Three-dimensional pixelwise parameter maps were also evaluated.Highly undersampled data were successfully reconstructed with 3D through-time radial GRAPPA to achieve a high-resolution 3-dimensional renal DCE-MRI examination. The acquisition was completely free breathing, and the images were registered to compensate for respiratory motion. This allowed for an accurate high-resolution 3D quantitative renal functional mapping of perfusion and filtration parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI can provide key insight into renal function. DCE MRI is typically achieved through an injection of a gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agent, which has desirable T1 quenching and tracer kinetics. However, significant T2* blooming effects and signal voids can arise when Gd becomes very concentrated, especially in the renal medulla and pelvis. One MRI sequence designed to alleviate T2* effects is the ultrashort echo time (UTE) sequence. In the present study, we observed T2* blooming in the inner medulla of the mouse kidney, despite using UTE at an echo time of 20 microseconds and a low dose of 0.03 mmol/kg Gd. We applied quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and resolved the signal void into a positive susceptibility signal. The susceptibility values [in parts per million (ppm)] were converted into molar concentrations of Gd using a calibration curve. We determined the concentrating mechanism (referred to as the concentrating index) as a ratio of maximum Gd concentration in the inner medulla to the renal artery. The concentrating index was assessed longitudinally over a 17-wk course (3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 17 wk of age). We conclude that the UTE-based DCE method is limited in resolving extreme T2* content caused by the kidney's strong concentrating mechanism. QSM was able to resolve and confirm the source of the blooming effect to be the large positive susceptibility of concentrated Gd. UTE with QSM can complement traditional magnitude UTE and offer a powerful tool to study renal pathophysiology.},

Each examination depicts one identified suspicious breast tumor. Among them, 75 cases were verified as malignant and 40 were benign by the biopsy results. A computer-aided detection scheme was applied to segment breast regions and the suspicious tumor depicted on the sequentially scanned MR images of each case. We then computed 18 kinetic features in which 6 were computed from the segmented breast tumor and 12 were BPE features from the background parenchymal regions (excluding the tumor). Support vector machine (SVM) based statistical learning classifiers were trained and optimized using different combinations of features that were computed either from tumor only or from both tumor and BPE. Each SVM was tested using a leave-one-case-out validation method and assessed using an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).When using kinetic features computed from tumors only, the maximum AUC is 0.865 ± 0.035. After fusing with the BPE features, AUC increased to 0.919 ± 0.029. At 90\% specificity, the tumor classification sensitivity increased by 13.2\%.The proposed quantitative BPE features provide valuable supplementary information to the kinetic features of breast tumors in DCE-MRI. Their addition to computer-aided diagnosis methodologies could improve breast cancer diagnosis based on DCE-MRI examinations.},

  Abstract                 = {Renal compartment segmentation from Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) images is an important task for functional kidney evaluation. Despite advancement in segmentation methods, most of them focus on segmenting an entire kidney on CT images, there still lacks effective and automatic solutions for accurate segmentation of internal renal structures (i.e. cortex, medulla and renal pelvis) from DCE-MRI images. In this paper, we introduce a method for renal compartment segmentation which can robustly achieve high segmentation accuracy for a wide range of DCE-MRI data, and meanwhile requires little manual operations and parameter settings. The proposed method consists of five main steps. First, we pre-process the image time series to reduce the motion artifacts caused by the movement of the patients during the scans and enhance the kidney regions. Second, the kidney is segmented as a whole based on the concept of Maximally Stable Temporal Volume (MSTV). The proposed MSTV detects anatomical structures that are homogeneous in the spatial domain and stable in terms of temporal dynamics. MSTV-based kidney segmentation is robust to noises and does not require a training phase. It can well adapt to kidney shape variations caused by renal dysfunction. Third, voxels in the segmented kidney are described by principal components (PCs) to remove temporal redundancy and noises. And then k-means clustering of PCs is applied to separate voxels into multiple clusters. Fourth, the clusters are automatically labeled as cortex, medulla and pelvis based on voxels' geometric locations and intensity distribution. Finally, an iterative refinement method is introduced to further remove noises in each segmented compartment. Experiments on 14 real clinical kidney datasets and 12 synthetic dataset demonstrate that results produced by our method match very well with those segmented manually and the performance of our method is superior to the other five existing methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Perfusion imaging has become an important image based tool to derive the physiological information in various applications, like tumor diagnostics and therapy, stroke, (cardio-) vascular diseases, or functional assessment of organs. However, even after 20 years of intense research in this field, perfusion imaging still remains a research tool without a broad clinical usage. One problem is the lack of standardization in technical aspects which have to be considered for successful quantitative evaluation; the second problem is a lack of tools that allow a direct integration into the diagnostic workflow in radiology.Five compartment models, namely, a one compartment model (1CP), a two compartment exchange (2CXM), a two compartment uptake model (2CUM), a two compartment filtration model (2FM) and eventually the extended Toft's model (ETM) were implemented as plugin for the DICOM workstation OsiriX. Moreover, the plugin has a clean graphical user interface and provides means for quality management during the perfusion data analysis. Based on reference test data, the implementation was validated against a reference implementation. No differences were found in the calculated parameters.We developed open source software to analyse DCE-MRI perfusion data. The software is designed as plugin for the DICOM Workstation OsiriX. It features a clean GUI and provides a simple workflow for data analysis while it could also be seen as a toolbox providing an implementation of several recent compartment models to be applied in research tasks. Integration into the infrastructure of a radiology department is given via OsiriX. Results can be saved automatically and reports generated automatically during data analysis ensure certain quality control.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the main tasks of the human kidneys is to maintain the homeostasis of the body's fluid and electrolyte balance by filtration of the plasma and excretion of the end products. Herein, the regulation of extracellular sodium in the kidney is of particular importance. Sodium MRI ((23)Na MRI) allows for the absolute quantification of the tissue sodium concentration (TSC) and thereby provides a direct link between TSC and tissue viability. Renal (23)Na MRI can provide new insights into physiological tissue function and viability thought to differ from the information obtained by standard (1)H MRI. Sodium imaging has the potential to become an independent surrogate biomarker not only for renal imaging, but also for oncology indications. However, this technique is now on the threshold of clinical implementation. Numerous, initial pre-clinical and clinical studies have already outlined the potential of this technique; however, future studies need to be extended to larger patient groups to show the diagnostic outcome. In conclusion, (23)Na MRI is seen as a powerful technique with the option to establish a non-invasive renal biomarker for tissue viability, but is still a long way from real clinical implementation.},

This approach consists of non-rigid 3D image registration of the moving kidney followed by k-means clustering of the voxel time courses with split between left and right kidney. This method was applied to four data sets acquired from healthy volunteers, using 1.5 T (2 exams) and 3 T scanners (2 exams). The proposed registration method reduced motion artifacts in the image time series and improved further analysis of the DCE-MRI data. The subsequent clustering to segment the kidney compartments was in agreement with manually delineations (similarity score of 0.96) in the same motion corrected images. The resulting mean intensity time curves clearly show the successive transition of contrast agent through kidney compartments (cortex, medulla, and pelvis). The proposed method for motion correction and kidney compartment segmentation might improve the validity and usefulness of further model-based pharmacokinetic analysis of kidney function in patients.},

  Abstract                 = {To develop a generic Open Source MRI perfusion analysis tool for quantitative parameter mapping to be used in a clinical workflow and methods for quality management of perfusion data. We implemented a classic, pixel-by-pixel deconvolution approach to quantify T1-weighted contrast-enhanced dynamic MR imaging (DCE-MRI) perfusion data as an OsiriX plug-in. It features parallel computing capabilities and an automated reporting scheme for quality management. Furthermore, by our implementation design, it could be easily extendable to other perfusion algorithms. Obtained results are saved as DICOM objects and directly added to the patient study. The plug-in was evaluated on ten MR perfusion data sets of the prostate and a calibration data set by comparing obtained parametric maps (plasma flow, volume of distribution, and mean transit time) to a widely used reference implementation in IDL. For all data, parametric maps could be calculated and the plug-in worked correctly and stable. On average, a deviation of 0.032 ± 0.02 ml/100 ml/min for the plasma flow, 0.004 ± 0.0007 ml/100 ml for the volume of distribution, and 0.037 ± 0.03 s for the mean transit time between our implementation and a reference implementation was observed. By using computer hardware with eight CPU cores, calculation time could be reduced by a factor of 2.5. We developed successfully an Open Source OsiriX plug-in for T1-DCE-MRI perfusion analysis in a routine quality managed clinical environment. Using model-free deconvolution, it allows for perfusion analysis in various clinical applications. By our plug-in, information about measured physiological processes can be obtained and transferred into clinical practice.},

Differences between healthy kidneys and kidneys subjected to AKI were analyzed using a paired t-test.Significant differences between ischemic and healthy kidneys could only be detected for the glomerular filtration rate. For all other calculated parameters, differences were present, however not significant. In rats with AKI, average single kidney GFR was 0.66 ± 0.37 ml/min for contralateral and 0.26 ± 0.12 ml/ min for diseased kidneys (P = 0.0254). For the healthy control group, the average GFR was 0.39 ± 0.06 ml/min and 0.41 ± 0.11 ml/min, respectively. Differences between diseased kidneys of AKI rats and ipsilateral kidneys of the healthy control group were significant (P = 0.0381).Significant differences of functional parameters reflecting damage of the renal tissue of kidneys with AKI compared to the contralateral, healthy kidneys could only be detected by GFR. GFR might be a useful parameter that allows for a spatially resolved detection of abnormal changes of renal tissue by AKI.},

Six animals were subjected to unilateral acute kidney injury and underwent perfusion imaging by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI). Renal blood flow was estimated from regions-of-interest depicting the cortex in the DCE-MRI perfusion maps. The perfusion models were compared by a paired t-test and Bland-Altman plots.No significant difference was found between the two compartment model and the deconvolution analysis (P=0.2807). Differences between healthy and diseased kidney in the AKI model were significant for both methods (P<0.05). A Bland-Altman plot showed no systematic errors, and values were equally distributed around the mean difference between the methods lying within the range of 1.96 standard deviations.Both quantification strategies could detect the kidneys that were impaired by AKI. When just aiming at RBF as a marker, a deconvolution analysis can provide similar values as the 2CFM. If functional parameters beyond RBF like glomerular filtration rate are needed, the 2CFM should be employed.},

There are many ways to test the GFR clinically, such as serum creatinine concentration, blood urea nitrogen and SPECT renography, however, they're all not a good standard to evaluate the early damage of renal function. In recent years, the improvement of MRI hardware and software makes it possible to reveal physiological characteristics such as renal blood flow or GFR by dynamic contrast enhancement magnetic resonance perfusion renography (DEC MRPR). MRPR is a method used to monitor the transit of contrast material, typically a gadolinium chelate, through the renal cortex, the medulla, and the collecting system. This review outlines the basics of DCE MRPR included acquisition of dynamic MR perfusion imaging, calculation of the contrast concentration from signal intensity and compartment models, and some challenges of MRPR method faced in prospective clinical application.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI is widely used for the measurement of tissue perfusion and to assess organ function. MR renography, which is acquired using a DCE sequence, can measure renal perfusion, filtration and concentrating ability. Optimization of the DCE acquisition protocol is important for the minimization of the error propagation from the acquired signals to the estimated parameters, thus improving the precision of the parameters. Critical to the optimization of contrast-enhanced T1 -weighted protocols is the balance of the T1 -shortening effect across the range of gadolinium (Gd) contrast concentration in the tissue of interest. In this study, we demonstrate a Monte Carlo simulation approach for the optimization of DCE MRI, in which a saturation-recovery T1 -weighted gradient echo sequence is simulated and the impact of injected dose (D) and time delay (TD, for saturation recovery) is tested. The results show that high D and/or high TD cause saturation of the peak arterial signals and lead to an overestimation of renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). However, the use of low TD (e.g. 100 ms) and low D leads to similar errors in RPF and GFR, because of the Rician bias in the pre-contrast arterial signals. Our patient study including 22 human subjects compared TD values of 100 and 300 ms after the injection of 4 mL of Gd contrast for MR renography. At TD = 100 ms, we computed an RPF value of 157.2 ± 51.7 mL/min and a GFR of 33.3 ± 11.6 mL/min. These results were all significantly higher than the parameter estimates at TD = 300 ms: RPF = 143.4 ± 48.8 mL/min (p = 0.0006) and GFR = 30.2 ± 11.5 mL/min (p = 0.0015). In conclusion, appropriate optimization of the DCE MRI protocol using simulation can effectively improve the precision and, potentially, the accuracy of the measured parameters.

  Abstract                 = {Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) MRI data of kidney, while indicative of tissue oxygenation level (Po2), is in fact influenced by multiple confounding factors, such as R2, perfusion, oxygen permeability, and hematocrit. We aim to explore the feasibility of extracting tissue Po2 from renal BOLD data. A method of two steps was proposed: first, a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate blood oxygen saturation (SHb) from BOLD signals, and second, an oxygen transit model to convert SHb to tissue Po2. The proposed method was calibrated and validated with 20 pigs (12 before and after furosemide injection) in which BOLD-derived tissue Po2 was compared with microprobe-measured values. The method was then applied to nine healthy human subjects (age: 25.7 ± 3.0 yr) in whom BOLD was performed before and after furosemide. For the 12 pigs before furosemide injection, the proposed model estimated renal tissue Po2 with errors of 2.3 ± 5.2 mmHg (5.8 ± 13.4\%) in cortex and -0.1 ± 4.5 mmHg (1.7 ± 18.1\%) in medulla, compared with microprobe measurements. After injection of furosemide, the estimation errors were 6.9 ± 3.9 mmHg (14.2 ± 8.4\%) for cortex and 2.6 ± 4.0 mmHg (7.7 ± 11.5\%) for medulla. In the human subjects, BOLD-derived medullary Po2 increased from 16.0 ± 4.9 mmHg (SHb: 31 ± 11\%) at baseline to 26.2 ± 3.1 mmHg (SHb: 53 ± 6\%) at 5 min after furosemide injection, while cortical Po2 did not change significantly at ∼58 mmHg (SHb: 92 ± 1\%). Our proposed method, validated with a porcine model, appears promising for estimating tissue Po2 from renal BOLD MRI data in human subjects.},

  Abstract                 = {The identification of small structures (blobs) from medical images to quantify clinically relevant features, such as size and shape, is important in many medical applications. One particular application explored here is the automated detection of kidney glomeruli after targeted contrast enhancement and magnetic resonance imaging. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm, termed the Hessian-based Difference of Gaussians (HDoG), to segment small blobs (e.g., glomeruli from kidney) from 3D medical images based on local convexity, intensity and shape information. The image is first smoothed and pre-segmented into small blob candidate regions based on local convexity. Two novel 3D regional features (regional blobness and regional flatness) are then extracted from the candidate regions. Together with regional intensity, the three features are used in an unsupervised learning algorithm for auto post-pruning. HDoG is first validated in a 2D form and compared with other three blob detectors from literature, which are generally for 2D images only. To test the detectability of blobs from 3D images, 240 sets of simulated images are rendered for scenarios mimicking the renal nephron distribution observed in contrast-enhanced, 3D MRI. The results show a satisfactory performance of HDoG in detecting large numbers of small blobs. Two sets of real kidney 3D MR images (6 rats, 3 human) are then used to validate the applicability of HDoG for glomeruli detection. By comparing MRI to stereological measurements, we verify that HDoG is a robust and efficient unsupervised technique for 3D blobs segmentation.},

With Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and informed consent/assent, 23 consecutive pediatric patients were recruited for this study. Free-breathing DCE MRI with ∼1 mm(3) spatial resolution and a 6.5-sec frame rate was acquired on a 3T scanner. Undersampled data were reconstructed with a compressed sensing method without motion correction (FB-CS) and the proposed method (FB-LR). A follow-up respiratory-triggered acquisition (RT-CS) was performed as a reference standard. The reconstructed images were evaluated independently by two radiologists. Wilcoxon tests were performed to test the hypothesis that there was no significant difference between different reconstructions. Quantitative evaluation of contrast dynamics was also performed.The mean score of overall image quality of FB-LR was 4.0 on a 5-point scale, significantly better (P < 0.05) than FB-CS reconstruction (mean score 2.9), and similar to RT-CS (mean score 4.1). FB-LR also matched the temporal fidelity of contrast dynamics with a root mean square error less than 5\%.Fast 3D free-breathing DCE MRI with high scan efficiency and image quality similar to respiratory-triggered acquisition is feasible in a pediatric clinical setting.},

  Abstract                 = {Arterial spin-labeled (ASL) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been proposed to quantitatively assess vascularity in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, there are intrinsic differences between these 2 imaging methods, such as the relative contribution of vascular permeability and blood flow to signal intensity for DCE MRI. We found a correlation between ASL perfusion and the DCE-derived volume transfer constant and rate constant parameters in renal masses > 2 cm in size and these measures correlated with microvessel density in clear cell RCC.The objective of this study was to investigate potential correlations between perfusion using arterial spin-labeled (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI-derived quantitative measures of vascularity in renal masses > 2 cm and to correlate these with microvessel density (MVD) in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).Informed written consent was obtained from all patients before imaging in this Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant, institutional review board-approved, prospective study. Thirty-six consecutive patients scheduled for surgery of a known renal mass > 2 cm underwent 3T ASL and DCE MRI. ASL perfusion measures (PASL) of mean, peak, and low perfusion areas within the mass were correlated to DCE-derived volume transfer constant (K(trans)), rate constant (Kep), and fractional volume of the extravascular extracellular space (Ve) in the same locations using a region of interest analysis. MRI data were correlated to MVD measures in the same tumor regions in ccRCC. Spearman correlation was used to evaluate the correlation between PASL and DCE-derived measurements, and MVD. P < .05 was considered statistically significant.Histopathologic diagnosis was obtained in 36 patients (25 men; mean age 58 ± 12 years). PASL correlated with K(trans) (ρ = 0.48 and P = .0091 for the entire tumor and ρ = 0.43 and P = .03 for the high flow area, respectively) and Kep (ρ = 0.46 and P = .01 for the entire tumor and ρ = 0.52 and P = .008 for the high flow area, respectively). PASL (ρ = 0.66; P = .0002), K(trans) (ρ = 0.61; P = .001), and Kep (ρ = 0.64; P = .0006) also correlated with MVD in high and low perfusion areas in ccRCC.PASL correlated with the DCE-derived measures of vascular permeability and flow, K(trans) and Kep, in renal masses > 2 cm in size. Both measures correlated to MVD in clear cell histology.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MR renography has been identified as an interesting tool to determine single-kidney GFR. However, a fundamental issue for the applicability of MR-based estimate of single-kidney GFR is selecting a balance between spatial and temporal resolution of DCE-MRI data. The purpose is to assess the feasibility of GFR estimate from high-resolution (HR) dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI in a routine clinical modal. Standard MR renography (2.4s/phase, total 4min; 4-ml Gd) and five-phase, HR-based imaging protocol (0, 30, 70, 120, and 240s; 0.05mmol/kg Gd) were prospectively performed in twelve volunteers who were scheduled for routine renal MRI. Data were plotted with Patlak, two-compartment modified Tofts model (2CTM), and two-compartment filtration model (2CFM) for GFR estimate. During all the measurements, only the signal intensities in the aorta and whole kidney parenchyma were considered. Standard 2CFM and 2CTM produced lower residuals over the fitted interval than HR-based measures (p<0.05); and HR-bases 2CFM and 2CTM did not reflect significant correlation to standard values. Standard Patlak plots with 0-240s data points produced significantly lower GFR and higher residuals than that plots with 0-120s data points (p<0.05). HR-based Patlak plots with 0, 30, 70, and 120s data points significantly correlated with reference values (Pearson ρ=0.97, p<0.01), and produced a 33.2\% underestimation of reference value, which was better than that plots with 0, 30, 70, 120, and 240s data points (ρ=0.92, p<0.01; 58.6\% underestimation of reference value). It concludes that it is feasible to estimate GFR with HR-based DCE-MRI and appreciate kinetic model. Patlak plots from 0, 30, 70, and 120s data points is better than plots from 0, 30, 70, 120, and 240s data points.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective: To explore the characteristics of blood oxygen level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-MRI) in healthy native kidneys. Methods: Seventy-nine patients without chronic kidney disease underwent BOLD-MRI with T2* spoiled gradient recalled echo sequences. BOLD images were analyzed using R2*map software to produce an R2* pseudo-color map. Cortical and medullary R2* values were analyzed in both kidneys and in both sexes. Different regional R2* values in the cortex and medulla were also analyzed. Physiological indices including age, height, weight, body mass index, body surface area, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were recorded. Correlations between R2* value and physiological indices were determined. Results: Renal cortical R2* values were lower than values in the medulla (p < 0.001). Female and male cortical R2* values were also lower than the corresponding values in the medulla (p < 0.001). Renal medullary R2* values in the lower renal pole were lower than values in the middle and upper poles (p = 0.001). Age was positively correlated with R2* values in the medulla (r = 0.32, p = 0.004). eGFR was negatively correlated with both cortical R2* values (r = -0.26, p = 0.02) and medullary R2* values (r = -0.29, p = 0.009). Conclusions: BOLD-MRI can directly visualize renal oxygenation. There was variation in the oxygenation of different regions of the kidney. Renal cortical and medullary oxygenation in healthy kidneys decreased with patient age. eGFR also decreased with patient age. © 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

  Abstract                 = {Image segmentation is typically applied to locate objects and boundaries, and it is an essential process that supports medical diagnosis, surgical planning, and treatments in medical applications. Generally, this process is done by clinicians manually, which may be accurate but tedious and very time consuming. To facilitate the process, numerous interactive segmentation methods have been proposed that allow the user to intervene in the process of segmentation by incorporating prior knowledge, validating results and correcting errors. The accurate segmentation results can potentially be obtained by such user-interactive process. In this work, we propose a novel framework of interactive medical image segmentation for clinical applications, which combines digital curves and the active contour model to obtain promising results. It allows clinicians to quickly revise or improve contours by simple mouse actions. Meanwhile, the snake model becomes feasible and practical in clinical applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for medical images in clinical applications.},

  Abstract                 = {To establish arterial spin labelling (ASL) for quantitative renal perfusion measurements in a rat model at 3 Tesla and to test the diagnostic significance of ASL and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) in a model of acute kidney injury (AKI).ASL and DCE-MRI were consecutively employed on six Lewis rats, five of which had a unilateral ischaemic AKI. All measurements in this study were performed on a 3 Tesla MR scanner using a FAIR True-FISP approach and a TWIST sequence for ASL and DCE-MRI, respectively. Perfusion maps were calculated for both methods and the cortical perfusion of healthy and diseased kidneys was inter- and intramethodically compared using a region-of-interest based analysis.Both methods produce significantly different values for the healthy and the diseased kidneys (P<0.01). The mean difference was 147±47 ml/100 g/min and 141±46 ml/100 g/min for ASL and DCE-MRI, respectively. ASL measurements yielded a mean cortical perfusion of 416±124 ml/100 g/min for the healthy and 316±102 ml/100 g/min for the diseased kidneys. The DCE-MRI values were systematically higher and the mean cortical renal blood flow (RBF) was found to be 542±85 ml/100 g/min (healthy) and 407±119 ml/100 g/min (AKI).Both methods are equally able to detect abnormal perfusion in diseased (AKI) kidneys. This shows that ASL is a capable alternative to DCE-MRI regarding the detection of abnormal renal blood flow. Regarding absolute perfusion values, nontrivial differences and variations remain when comparing the two methods.},
